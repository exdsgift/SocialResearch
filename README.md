# ESS round 11 - 2023. Social inequalities in health, Gender in contemporary Europe
The European Social Survey (ESS) is an academically driven cross-national survey that has been conducted across Europe since its establishment in 2001. Every two years, face-to-face interviews are conducted with newly selected, cross-sectional samples.
The survey measures the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of diverse populations in more than thirty nations.

The European Social Survey (ESS) is an academically driven, cross-national survey, founded in 2001. It has been administered in 40 countries to date. The survey measures the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of diverse populations in more than thirty nations. The main aims of the ESS are to:

- operate a Research Infrastructure providing high quality data measuring change (and stability) over time within and between European countries in their living conditions, social structure, public opinion and attitudes;
- practise and promote the highest scientific standards in cross-national comparative research in the social sciences;
- continue the development of ESS infrastructure through ongoing methodological research and innovation;
- facilitate training in the effective use of ESS data;
- ensure the visibility, accessibility and reach of ESS data among researchers in the social sciences and beyond, policy makers and the wider public, at both the national and international levels.

The survey involves strict random probability sampling, aims for a high response rate and uses rigorous translation protocols. 

The 11th ESS round covers 31 countries.

ESS data collection is based on an hour-long face-to-face interview. The survey includes questions on a variety of core topics repeated from previous rounds of the survey and two modules developed for Round 11. These are “Gender in Contemporary Europe: Rethinking Equality and the Backlash” and “Social Inequalities in Health and their Determinants”. The latter is a partial repeat of a module from Round 7. 

In ESS11, Czechia was conducted as a self-completion survey. The data and documentation are available in the Country Documentation section for Czechia.

From Round 7 the ESS has been legally established as a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). Central costs are funded through ESS ERIC membership fees (Members, Observers and Guests), while costs of fieldwork and national coordination are funded nationally.
