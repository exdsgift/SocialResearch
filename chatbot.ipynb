The literature has dealt\\nmainly with the former, while less attention has been given to the latter. This paper advances a noveltheoretical approach to inquire about trust in local institutions, which is also used to test national ones.We posit that trust is affected by the perceptions individuals have of the physical space where they live.Both a) the perceived quality of life in the neighbourhood where individuals live and b) the neighbour-hood (perceived) peripherality are hypothesized to af fect trust in local (and to a lesser extent) national\\ninstitutions. We test our hypotheses in Italy, over a large representative sample of more than 40.000\\nrespondents. We show that both variables are crucial predictors of local trust, but only the perceivedquality of life predicts national tru st. Equally important, social, cultu ral and economic individual capital\\ndoes not modify the relation.\\nKeywords: local trust; national trust; periphery; quality of life; multilevel analysis\\nIntroduction\\nSince the seminal work by David Easton on systems analysis ( 1965;1975), the study of support for\\nand trust in institutions in democratic systems has been key for political scientists. This is because\\ntrust in institutions is crucial for the stability of democratic regimes and, more generally, for the\\noverall health of a democracy (Braithwaite and Levi, 1998; Hetherington, 1998; Misztal, 1996;\\nWarren, 1999). Understandably, the vast majority of the scholarly literature has concentrated its\\nefforts in studying institutional trust at the national level, given the key relevance of national govern-\\nments in policymaking. However, in the last decades, central governments have devolved relevant\\nshares of their competences to regional and local authorities (Jennings, 1998;H o o g h e et al.,2010):\\nlocal governments have become so relevant (Weitz-Shapiro, 2008; Tang and Huhe, 2016)t h a ts e v -\\neral studies both in advanced and developing countries (Chanley, Rudolph and Rahn, 2000;\\nChristensen and Lægreid, 2005; Cleary and Stokes, 2006; Cordova and Layton, 2016;U s l a n e r ,\\n2018; Zmerli and Van der Meer, 2017;W o l a k , 2020) now acknowledge that trust in and support\\nfor local governments is at least as relevant as trust in national institutions.\\nNevertheless, comparatively less attention has been devoted to trust in local institutions\\n(Christensen and Lægreid, 2005 ; Rahn and Rudolph, 2005 ; Kelleher and Wolak, 2007 ; Cleary\\nand Stokes, 2006 ; Wolak, 2020 ). This is unfortunate, since the literature has underlined that there\\nare good reasons to analyse trust in local and national institutions as two separate objects (startingfrom the fact that local and national trust follow different patterns, with the former being higher\\ncompared to the latter, Fitzgerald and Wolak, 2016 ).\\n© The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of European Consortium for Political Research.European Political Science Review (2023), 15, 641 –658\\ndoi:10.1017/S1755773923000140\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University PressIn this respect, several contributions show that when differentiating between local and national\\ntrust, citizens focus on the performance of each institution (Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Van Elsas,\\n2015 ;M u ˜noz, 2017 ). However, the literature has so far focussed mainly on the relationship\\nbetween (objective) institutional performances (measured in terms of provision of local services)\\nand trust (Stein et al.,2021 ). In this paper, we advance a different and original perspective on the\\nstudy of trust in local institutions which looks at the effect on local trust of the perceptions that\\ncitizens have about the quality of life in their neighbourhoods.\\nBorrowing from Huckfeldt ’s(1986 ) intuition which suggests that the perceptions individuals\\nhave of their everyday life in their local space (i.e., their neighbourhoods) is crucial in shaping their\\npolitical attitudes and behaviours, we conceive the quality of life in the neighbourhood as encom-passing two conceptually distinguished factors: on the one hand, the perceived neighbourhood\\ndecay, which refers to the perception that individuals have about the physical space of the neigh-\\nbourhood in which they live; and, on the other, the perceived periphery, which is related to howfar essential public services are perceived to be from the individual ’s neighbourhood. Both forms\\nof neighbourhood discontent are then hypothesised to negatively affect trust in local institutions.\\nAlthough our locally based predictors are primarily hypothesised to affect trust in local insti-\\ntutions, we also elaborate on the (untested) idea that local level issues could also act as potential\\ndrivers of trust in national institutions. We deem this aspect to be a further innovative contribu-\\ntion of this paper. Indeed, while the existing literature has worked on the effect of national level\\nvariables on trust in local institutions, no paper has inquired so far whether and to what extent\\nlocal level determinants affect trust in national institutions.\\nTo test our framework, we rely on an individual level survey of Italian citizens provided by the\\nItalian National Institute of Statistics-ISTAT (approximately 40.000 respondents). Employing a\\nseries of multilevel regression models, our results prove that both perceived periphery and neigh-\\nbourhood decay are amongst the most powerful predictors of trust in local institutions (and, to a\\nlesser extent, of national ones). Furthermore, we find that the relevance of these new predictors is\\nnot conditioned by economic, social, and cultural capital.\\nThe sources of institutional trust\\nPolitical trust is generally defined as ‘a basic evaluative orientation towards the government\\nfounded on how well the government is operating according to people ’s normative expectations ’\\n(Hetherington, 1998 , p. 791). The literature that tries to explain the sources of trust and distrust is\\nabundant (Levi and Stoker, 2000 ; Bertsou, 2019 ) and it has provided very different explanations of\\ntrust in institutions. In this section, we summarize this literature in order to provide a general\\nframework, which we then use as a point of departure for a more specific analysis of trust in insti-\\ntutions at both the local and national levels.\\nIn their famous contribution, Mishler and Rose ( 2001 ) distinguish between the cultural and\\ninstitutional approach to the study of trust. Cultural approaches posit that the origin of political\\ntrust is exogenous to the political system and is mostly connected to the early socialization ofindividuals: ‘from birth, individuals learn to trust or distrust other people by experiencing\\nhow others in the culture treat them and how, in return, others react to their behavior ’\\n(Mishler and Rose, 2001 , p.34). This is a process that begins within families, and it is then\\nextended to interactions and connections with other socializing agents (schools, pairs, etc.). As\\nindividual networks expand, people tend to increase their trust in other people (Brehm and\\nRahn, 1997 ). This reciprocal trust is at the core of Putnam ’s social capital ( 1993 ,2000 ) (i.e., vol-\\nuntarism, membership in associations, extensive social networks, etc.). Social capital produces a\\ncivic culture whose values of interpersonal, social, and institutional trust are transmitted from642 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressgeneration to generation (Almond and Verba, 1989 ; Putnam et al., 1993 ; Putnam 2000 ). So, for\\ncultural approaches, interpersonal trust is positively connected with institutional trust.1\\nThe institutional approach, on the other hand, frames trust in institutions as politically endog-\\nenous (Mishler and Rose, 2001 ), meaning that it depends on the (perceived) capacity of the politi-\\ncal system and its political institutions to perform in a satisfactory way. In other words, trust in\\ninstitutions is generated within the political system and depends on the performance of political\\ninstitutions.\\nBoth cultural and institutional approaches have been articulated along two dimensions, i.e.,\\nmacro and micro. Macro cultural approaches to institutional trust have mostly focussed on under-\\nstanding how societies, characterised by different levels of interpersonal trust, also differ in terms\\nof trust in institutions. However, while societies with a strong civic culture have, on average, higher\\nlevels of institutional trust, ‘socialization into a culturally homogenous society nonetheless allows\\nsubstantial variation among individuals ’(Mishler and Rose, 2001 , p.35). To account for the differ-\\nences between individuals, cultural approaches have thus also focussed on the effect of individualsocio-demographic characteristics on trust in institutions (i.e., micro cultural approaches to insti-\\ntutional trust). In this vein, age, social class, income, cognitive ability, and education have been\\nwidely analysed (Rohrschneider and Schmitt-Beck, 2002 ; Campbell, 2004 ; Christensen and\\nLægreid, 2005 ; Anderson and Singer, 2008 ; Jennings et al .,2009 ; Hakhverdian and Mayne,\\n2012 ; Gustavsen et al.,2017 ; Holmberg et al.,2017 ). The results of this literature proved to be\\nmixed, meaning that the conventional wisdom for which highly sophisticated individuals with\\na high socio-economic-status trust more in institutions is true, although results vary a lot acrosscountries and political contexts (Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Dalton, 2004 ; Holmberg et al.,2017 ).\\nJust to give an example, education is negatively related to institutional trust in corrupt societies,\\nbut the sign of the relation is reversed in clean societies (Hakhverdian and Mayne, 2012 ).\\nMoreover, the literature has shown the importance of attitudes and psychological traits, such\\nas internal efficacy, the big five personality traits, ideological orientations, and interest in politics\\n(Newton, 2001 ; McLaren, 2011 ; Holmberg et al.,2017 ; Ackermann et al.,2019 ).\\nOn a different note, macro institutional approaches have focussed on the effect on trust of those\\naggregate-level variables measuring the objective performance of institutions: GDP growth and\\nlevels of unemployment are the usual suspects, even though the significance of these variables\\nand their direction is disputed (Chanley et al.,2000 ; Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Van der Meer,\\n2010 ; Wolak, 2020 ). Other scholars have also focussed on the level of corruption, institutional\\ntransparency, and political scandals, showing that corruption and lack of transparency under-mines institutional trust (Chanley et al .,2000 ; Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Andersen and\\nTverdova, 2003 ; Morris and Klesner, 2010 ; Van der Meer, 2010\\n; Hakhverdian and Mayne,\\n2012 ; Grimmelikhuijsen et al. ,2013 ).\\nThe micro level approach, instead, has focussed on individual perceptions of country- or local-\\nlevel performances, showing that subjective economic evaluations are more powerful predictors of\\ninstitutional trust than objective ones and that sociotropic evaluations are more relevant than ego-\\ntropic ones (Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Dalton, 2004 ; Wroe, 2016 ). More recent studies have also\\nshown that individual perceptions of economic insecurity (mainly due the negative effects of de-\\nindustrialization, technological change, and de-unionization, see Wroe, 2016 ) have a negative\\neffect on institutional trust. Other works have looked at the perception of public services offeredby the institutions. These studies concentrate mainly on the local level (Kelly and Swindell, 2002 ;\\nBouckaert and van de Walle, 2003 ; Downe et al.,2013 ; Ellinas and Lamprianou, 2014 ) and use\\nsatisfaction with services such as education, health, transportation, bureaucracy or local council-\\nlors ’ethical behaviour as explanatory variables for the support of institutions. Other indicators\\n1Nonetheless, several studies (Brehm and Rahn, 1997 ; Knack, 2003 ; Bekkers, 2012 ; van Ingen and Bekkers, 2015 ) have\\npartially challenged this perspective, showing that the causal direction goes from institutional trust to social trust, whereasthe reverse causal effect is limited.Neighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 643\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressprove to be equally important, i.e., process and probity (Citrin and Stoker, 2018 ). Here the idea is\\nthat when citizens deem the institutional processes to be fair and public officials are considered to\\nbe honest, institutional trust increases (Borre and Andersen, 1997 ). Overall, the literature shows\\nthat both subjectively- and objectively-measured performance matters (e.g., DeHoog et al.,1990 ;\\nFitzgerald and Wolak, 2016 ). To the extent local and national institutions (are perceived to)\\ndeliver, support for these institutions increases as well.\\nWhile both approaches to institutional trust (i.e., cultural and institutional) provide fruitful\\ninsights on the drivers of support for institutions, our contribution to the study of local (and\\nnational) trust takes the micro-level institutional approach as a point of departure, although,as we shall see, in fact, it goes beyond it. Local trust (as a form of specific support) has been mainly\\nanalysed considering local institutions as service providers and citizens as service consumers who\\nevaluate institutional performances and, as a consequence, either trust or distrust the institutions\\n(Kelly and Swindell, 2002 ; Bouckaert and van de Walle, 2003 ; Gustavsen et al.,2017 ; Christensen\\net al.,2020 ). However, local public services, in our understanding, represent just a narrow con-\\nception of local institutions ’performances. In this regard, the literature has given scant attention\\nto one possible crucial aspect, that is the role played by broader perceptions of quality of life inlocal communities, something that we discuss in the next section.\\nPerceived physical environment as a determinant of institutional trust\\nAs stated above, the literature on local trust has focussed mainly on the relationship between theprovision of (local) services and trust (Stein et al.,2021 ). Only very recently, McKay et al.(2021 )\\nintroduced perceived social marginality and perceived economic deprivation in their analysis of\\npolitical trust. We partly change the perspective, shifting our focus from individual economic sta-tus to the perceptions that citizens have about the quality of life in the neighbourhood. We intend\\nthe latter as a more encompassing phenomenon compared to the perceived quality of public serv-\\nices or the perceived social and economic deprivation. Under the label of quality of life, we include\\ntwo concepts: first, the perception of well-being in the neighbourhood, referring to the perceptions\\nabout the quality of the physical space where individuals live (hereafter, neighbourhood decay).\\nSecond, the more service-oriented concept of periphery, i.e., how distant individuals perceive they\\nare from basic public services (hereafter, periphery). Notice that our focus here is on the percep-tions of individuals. Indeed, while objective measures of individual distance could be a good proxy\\nfor marginality, it is also important to highlight that they are not able to capture the quality of life\\nin the neighbourhood. It is possible that individuals live relatively (and objectively) close to public\\nservices, but still the quality of life in the neighbourhood is not perceived in positive terms.\\nIn both cases, the mechanism that might link perceived physical space in the neighbourhood\\nand institutional trust is analogous. On the one hand, people perceiving the place they live as far-\\naway from the ‘centre ’, not just in terms of physical distance, but also in terms of public services\\nprovision, might feel abandoned by the local authorities and, if this effect goes beyond the local\\nlevel, by the national authorities as well. The literature has already shown, in this regard, the\\nimportance of developing individual place attachment to revitalise the neighbourhood (Brown\\net al.,2003 ). On the other, if individuals perceive a low level of general well-being in the neigh-\\nbourhood, they might consider the institutions as incapable of delivering results. In our under-standing, the two mechanisms should be kept separate as they capture two distinct aspects of\\nurban life, which do not necessarily coexist. A clear example here is the emergence of completely\\nnew neighbourhoods around shopping centres and malls, in a process of reconfiguration of public\\nspaces that involves both advanced and developing countries. Separated from the city centres,\\nmalls are by now considered by many as new contemporary squares (Staeheli and Mitchell,\\n2006 ), and it is exactly around these contemporary squares that new forms of urban aggregation\\nemerge. Responding to the needs of providing a reassuring environment to consumers, these new644 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressurban spaces are kept clean and tidy (Staeheli and Mitchell, 2006 ). Yet, the organisation of essen-\\ntial services takes time. And, as people are attracted by the initially low prices for housing and rentsin these new neighbourhoods, these spaces become rapidly populated, but often not sufficiently\\nserved by public services. Thus, despite the absence of urban decay, citizens living in these places\\ntend to be disconnected from city centres.\\nMore in detail, for us periphery is the perceived distance of individuals from basic and essential\\nservices, such as hospitals, supermarkets, and drugstores. In this respect, while we cannot assume\\na priori that closer public services would be better than public services located far away from the\\nplace of living, having them close means at least that local communities try to connect the area and\\nto provide a specific service. Also, while the extent to which an individual belongs to a peripheryhas been measured through the distance from the capital or to the ‘centre ’of a specific area\\n(Wolak, 2020 ), we believe that a ‘subjective ’perception of periphery should better capture feelings\\nof disconnection from real (or imagined) urban, political, and social centres. In this perspective,the perceived distance from basic services assumes the symbolic meaning of exclusion.\\nAs stated above, the perceived distance from public services is not necessarily related to the\\nwell-being in the neighbourhood. Nonetheless, well-being in itself has been seldom analysed inthe literature. Even though the recent literature has shown a connection between (perceived) localgovernment performance and trust in local institutions (with citizens being capable of properly\\njudging the performance of public services) (Van Ryzin, 2007 ), these studies have focussed on\\nspecific public policy outcomes and their relationship with good governance (Bouckaert andvan de Walle, 2003 ), rather than on the quality of the individuals ’surrounding environment.\\nMore recent contributions show the importance of the centre-periphery cleavage in shaping trust\\n(Mitsch et al.,2021 ). Well-connected areas that took advantage of globalisation sharply differ from\\nleft-behind areas (post-industrial cities and suburban communities), where globalisation impactednegatively on the quality of life and social division from the ‘centre ’grew exponentially (Jennings\\nand Stoker, 2017; 2016 ): the reaction against the mainstream is evident in these areas (Rodríguez-\\nPose, 2018 ). Physically measured periphery, measured as the distance from the capital, is also\\nnegatively connected with trust in politicians, according to a recent study (Stein et al.,2021 ).\\nAll this given, to build our theoretical argument we move from the intuition by Huckfeldt\\n(1986 ), who stressed the critical relevance of neighbourhood contexts in forging individuals ’polit-\\nical attitudes and behaviours. In this respect, the empirical literature has abundantly demonstratedthat neighbourhood perceptions are linked to a number of attitudes and behaviours (Ellaway et al.,\\n2001 ), place attachment (Brown et al.,2003 ), and social capital (Kleinhans et al.,2007 ) amongst\\nothers. Individual life trajectories within the neighbourhood are not built in a vacuum, but within\\na physical space which inevitably affects how individuals perceive the context in which they liveand how they perceive themselves within this context.\\nOn this backdrop, we argue that liveable areas, i.e., non-polluted areas, with low levels of crime,\\nlow traffic, clean spaces, new roads etc., should reinforce trust in institutions, as citizens can eval-uate on a daily basis the responsiveness of the local community to an individual ’s basic needs.\\nCitizens living in such areas have the possibility to see with their eyes if the local community\\nis able to deliver.\\nThus, we posit that the perception of the surroundings is the closest proxy citizens have to\\nevaluate the performance of local community officials, and thus a potential key driver of supportfor local government. As Pfeiffer and Cloutier ( 2016 , pp. 270 –272) show in their review essay,\\nthere is a growing body of literature suggesting that the physical characteristics of a neighbour-\\nhood (housing design, street connectivity, availability of public spaces, perceived personal security,green areas) may lead to more or less social engagement, and ultimately, happiness. According to\\nMorris ( 2019 ), it is subjective well-being that is the main component that distinguishes suburbs\\nand cities, other conditions being almost similar. Thus, while it is true that the ‘revenge of the\\nplaces that don ’\\nt matter ’(Rodríguez-Pose, 2018 ) is related to policy outputs, such as income\\ninequality, it is also true that it is fostered by subjective perceptions of the physical space in whichNeighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 645\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressindividuals live, i.e., through the personal evaluation of being (not) part of the places excluded\\nfrom public services and forgotten by local politics.\\nOur main assumption is that perceptions of marginality and abandonment might spur distrust\\nin those institutions that, for proximity reasons, might be more easily identifiable as responsible\\nfor (and thus blamed for) such malaises. Furthermore, while the quality of life can reasonably\\naffect trust in local institutions, we cannot exclude that these perceptions may also produce var-\\niations in trust in national institutions as well. In particular, as long as neighbourhood contexts\\ncontribute both to the socialization of individuals and to forge their political attitudes and behav-\\niours, the experience and perceptions of such neighbourhoods might well be connected to moregeneral attitudes towards national politics. After all, the neighbourhood defines the breeding\\nground where political and social interactions occur in the first place, and where community\\nbonds are constructed (Putnam, 2000 ). To the extent these physical spaces are perceived as dete-\\nriorated, the quality of social interactions as well as the general levels of interpersonal and insti-\\ntutional trust might be negatively affected. For example, as Cohen and Dawson ( 1993 ) have\\nshown, among African Americans, that social isolation produced by neighbourhood decay tends\\nto alienate this group from politics, making them less likely to participate.\\nIn this respect, our argument differs from the existing literature since we problematize the rela-\\ntionship between individuals ’perception of their surrounding and the evaluation of institutions ’\\nperformance. On the one hand, from a rational choice perspective, citizens reward or punish insti-\\ntutions, which are responsible for providing specific services and improve the quality of the neigh-\\nbourhood. On the other hand, it might be equally true that the perception of the surroundings, inwhich the political socialization of the individuals occurs, is so pervasive that individuals translate\\nthis blaming mechanism to the national level as well. As a consequence, while the literature so far\\nhas looked at national level performances as partially responsible for the levels of trust locally, we\\nwant to explore whether the quality of life in the neighbourhood is responsible for national level\\ntrust. Or, to the opposite, all performances confined to the local level do not affect national trust,\\nas individuals separate between the spheres of influence of the institutions and thus correctly\\nblame/reward only the institution responsible for delivering a specific public service. We acknowl-edge that these mechanisms might not be the same across individuals (see e.g., Proszowska et al.,\\n2023 ;M u ˜noz, 2017 ): for example, less educated individuals could be more likely to blame both\\ngovernmental levels for their perceived marginality, being basically less likely to clearly attribute\\nresponsibility to (and thus blame) one or the other level of government. However, our main goal is\\nto check whether the quality of life in the neighbourhood (in its twofold specification, i.e., neigh-\\nbourhood decay and periphery) affects local trust primarily (and national trust secondarily).\\nDifferent twins? Local and national trust in comparison\\nSo far, our argument has been based on the implicit assumption that trust in local and national\\ninstitutions are different twins. This assumption, however, needs to be justified. The literature\\nanalysing commonalities and differences between trust in local and national institutions can\\nbe organised along the lines of two different approaches. On the one hand, a strain of the literature\\ntreats trust as a ‘monolithic ’bloc: citizens do not have the cognitive skills to differentiate between\\nlocal and national institutions (Sniderman, 1993 ; Denters, 2002 ) and they express their attitudes\\ntowards the (perceived) most relevant institution, usually the national institution, and then trans-\\nlate this attitude towards other institutional levels (we refer to this approach as the institutional\\nsalience approach) (e.g., Proszowska et al.,2023 ).\\nOn the other hand, other authors argue that citizens differentiate across different tiers of gov-\\nernments, although through different mechanisms (we refer to this approach as the differentiationapproach). Within this approach, proximity theories, for example, maintain that closeness to insti-\\ntutions matters, as closer institutions are considered by citizens as more reliable and trustworthy646 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Press(Proszowska et al.,2023 ; Denters and Klok, 2013 ; Hansen, 2013 ). Re-elaborating the paradox of\\ndistance stated by Frederickson ( 1997 ), Christensen and Laegrid ( 2005 , p. 488) claim that ‘[w]\\nhereas people trust government officials who are nearby, they believe the government officials\\nwho are far away are lazy, incompetent and probably dishonest ’. According to others, instead,\\ndifferentiation across institutional levels is produced by rational evaluations of citizens, who assess\\nthe performance of different institutions on their own merits (e.g., Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Van\\nElsas, 2015 ;M u ˜noz, 2017 ). In this perspective, both national and local trust are forms of specific\\nsupport, mostly determined by how well/bad the citizens evaluate the performance of different\\ninstitutions. Wolak ( 2020 ) for example, shows that trust in state government in the USA is asso-\\nciated with the character and performance of the state government, rather than being derived from\\ntrust in national institutions. Similarly, Steenvoorden and van der Meer ( 2021 , p. 9), focussing on\\nthe Dutch case, concludes that ‘local political performance matters for local political support ’,\\nalthough a certain degree of overlap between trust in local and national institutions do in fact exist.\\nThis review suggests that while the more general support of national institutions affects local\\ntrust, the latter is influenced by the performance of the local institutions, and as such, should be\\nanalysed separately from national trust. In addition, while the differentiation between local andnational trust is theoretically sound, it also offers to us the chance to test whether and to what\\nextent our indicators of the quality of life in neighbourhoods affect not only local trust but also\\nnational trust. This is, in our perspective, a further innovative aspect of this paper. Indeed, while\\nthe literature has mostly focussed on the effect of national trust on local trust, in fact, assessing\\nhow the performance of national institutions might affect trust in local institutions, we test here\\nthe potential inverse relationship, that is to say the impact of local determinants on trust in\\nnational institutions.\\nHypotheses\\nGiven our emphasis on the relevance of subjective perceptions of the places in which individuals\\nlive, our first hypothesis clearly connects local institutional trust to perceived neighbourhood con-\\nditions. As argued above, more intense feelings of peripherality and urban decay might be linked\\nto the inefficiency of local institutions to respond to the citizens ’needs. We thus hypothesise that:\\n1.1 The higher the perceptions of periphery of the neighbourhood and (1.2) the higher the per-\\nceptions of the neighbourhood ’s decay, the lower the trust in local institutions.\\nAlthough responsibility for neighbourhood decay and marginality can be more easily attributed to\\nlocal governments (which are the closest level of government to local communities and thus more\\neasily identifiable), it is not possible to exclude that the perception of the quality of life in the\\nneighbourhood might be then reflected into more general feelings of distrust in the overall\\nnational system. As we argued above, as neighbourhood contexts contribute to the formation\\nof political attitudes and behaviours, the experience and perceptions of such neighbourhoods\\nare hypothesised to be connected also to more general attitudes towards national politics. For\\nexample, research on the surge of protest and populist votes has widely shown that (objectiveand subjective) conditions of deprivation at the local level are associated with better electoral per-\\nformances of protest and populist parties, which often mobilised voters on an anti-systemic rhet-\\noric (Schulte-Cloos and Leininger, 2022 ). On this basis, we hypothesise that:\\n1.3 The higher the perceptions of periphery of the neighbourhood and (1.4) the higher the per-\\nceptions of the neighbourhood ’s decay, the lower the trust in national institutions.Neighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 647\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University PressWhile we posit that neighbourhood decay and periphery have a negative effect both on local and\\nnational trust, we also expect that our focal predictors should have stronger effects on local trust.\\nThis is because, based on our theoretical argument, both perceived neighbourhood decay and\\nperiphery should be primarily connected to individual experiences with local institutions.\\nAlso, we advance further expectations about possible interactive mechanisms with other pre-\\ndictors. We take into consideration here whether individual resources mitigate the negative effects\\nof the perceived environment. We do so by leveraging the CARs (i.e., capitals, assets and resour-\\nces) approach to social stratification and borrowing from the simple intuition according to which\\nindividuals enter the social life with ‘different endowments, capacities and resources ’(Savage,\\n2015 , p. 49), which are inherited from their past and produce either constrictions or enhanced\\nopportunities for their future. We assume that individual resources (and agency) might allow citi-\\nzens to experience, in a differentiated way, the everyday complexities associated with a peripheral\\nand/or decayed physical environment.\\nIn line with Savage and colleagues (Savage et al., 2005 ), we posit that three different types of\\nindividual resources (i.e., capitals) can differentiate the way in which citizens experience their\\nphysical environment and, as a consequence, their level of trust in political institutions. These\\nare: economic, cultural, and social capital. Economic capital refers to the overall wealth of indi-\\nviduals and it broadly indicates how far individuals are from material needs (Savage, 2015 ).\\nCultural capital broadly concerns cultural credentials that individuals can leverage in society.\\nIt refers to formal education, but also to tastes and interests, that are either socially approved\\nor disapproved of (i.e., socially legitimated) (Savage, 2015 , p. 92). In particular, the concept of\\ncultural capital encompasses broad cultural tastes and interests which are a revealing symbol\\nof an individual ’s position in society. As the literature does not agree on the role of education\\nin reinforcing institutional trust, with a higher level of education both acting as a driver for trust\\nin institutions but also for distrust in institutions, we rather investigate the role of cultural capital\\nwhile controlling for the education level of individuals, given its great social equalizer role.\\nFinally, social capital relates to human and socially relevant relations that generally produce\\npositive effects. Putnam et al., (1993 ) and Putnam ( 2000 ) refers to social capital as an asset fos-\\ntered by civic engagement and extensive social networks that are able to produce positive effects\\nboth at personal and social level. It thus refers to the extension and density of social networks,\\nwhich enormously affect individuals ’life chances. As Savage puts it (2015, p. 52) ‘contacts can\\naccumulate over time and may be a resource which can be mobilized to gain information about\\njobs, accommodations, exciting opportunities and so forth ’. Social connections are therefore\\nresources that structure opportunities in society.\\nIn general, our expectation is that those who are endowed with a high economic, cultural, and\\nsocial capital, even if living in a peripheral and decayed neighbourhood, can still leverage theirmaterial and immaterial resources to overcome systemic inefficiencies. To give few straightfor-\\nward examples: lack of public transportation can be overcome by using private cars or paying\\nfor a cab; people with a higher level of sophistication might find it easier to have information\\nto reduce the material and immaterial distance with the centre (cultural capital); people with high\\nsocial capital, can rely on large networks of friends for personal (emotional) and material (eco-\\nnomic) support; and they are more likely to be informed about chances and opportunities within\\nthe neighbourhood (but also outside it).\\nWe thus formalise the following hypotheses:\\n2. Higher levels of (2.1) economic, (2.2) social, and (2.3) cultural capital reduce the negative\\nimpact of perceived neighbourhoods ’periphery and decay on institutional trust (both local and\\nnational).648 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University PressData and methods\\nCase study and data sources\\nWe test our hypotheses focussing on a peculiar case study, Italy. This is a country with one of the\\nlowest levels of trust in national institutions in Western Europe and the country where Putnamet al., (1993 ) proposed his argument about social trust and on how democracy could perform\\nbetter when individuals trust each other and participate in public life. Despite this work, there\\nare no studies that focus on this context of the relation between the individual perception ofthe physical space and local (and national) institutional trust. We believe that, despite their limited\\ngeneralisability, discussing our hypotheses in relation to the Italian case is interesting in itself.\\nFirst, because of the lack of recent studies on the sources of variation in institutional trust in thiscountry; and second, because of the originality of our argument. We point out here that whileprevious studies focussed on the perception of public services and objective distance from city\\ncentres to capture the malaise of individuals, we make a step forward. We posit that, on the\\none hand, the perception of the environment in which citizens live cannot be simply relatedto the (perceived) quality of services, as life in neighbourhoods implies a broader set of interac-tions with the physical space. On the other, we maintain that the perceived peripherality of the\\nneighbourhood is something to be analysed separately from the perception of neighbour-\\nhood decay.\\nGiven the novelty of the theoretical approach to the study of trust, fine-grained data are needed\\nto test our hypotheses. From this point of view, Italy represents a unique opportunity, given the\\nlarge amount of individual-level data measuring perceived marginality and decay of neighbour-hoods in exceptionally large-N datasets which are provided by the Italian National Institute ofStatistics (ISTAT). We rely here on survey data gathered under the project ‘Aspects of daily life ’\\nin 2017.\\n2This is one of the largest surveys available for Italy and it covers the resident population\\nin private households, by interviewing through P.A.P.I. technique a range of 20.000 –50.000 indi-\\nviduals. Our samples vary from 41.108 to 41.127 respondents.\\nDependent variables\\nThe dependent variables are two questions on local and national trust. For national trust, we focuson a question on trust in National Parliament (as a robustness check we replicated the model usingas a dependent variable an additive index, which includes a question on the trust in the European\\nParliament besides the National Parliament, see below). For trust in local government, we rely on a\\nspecific question related to trust in local authorities (as robustness checks we replicated the modelusing as a dependent variable an additive index, which includes questions on the trust in provin-cial and regional governments, see the online Appendix, Section 1. The robustness checks are in\\nline with the findings presented in the main text, see Appendix, Section 3).\\n3. As mentioned earlier,\\nthere are good theoretical reasons for expecting local trust and national trust to behave differently:albeit a partial overlap is possible, the two concepts are not identical and the drivers for both\\nsources of trust might be different according to the literature. To empirically show that local\\nand national trust do not necessarily move together, we run two factor analyses in which weinclude all trust-related questions included in our survey. The first factor analysis includes five\\n2Data available at: https://www.istat.it/en/archivio/129959\\n3Beside the theoretical aspect, which we already discussed in the previous paragraph, and the empirical aspect that we\\nexplained in the following paragraph, we opted for these indices as a robustness check because of our research questions:as our focus is on the trust in institutions, we believe that for local trust an additive index can better capture the overall\\nsatisfaction with the performance of all institutions involved in policy making at the local level. In the Italian case, specific\\nlocal services (e.g., public schools or health services) are not managed solely by local institutions, but also by provinces and\\nregions. The same goes with trust in national institutions: both the national and European parliament are responsible for the\\npolicymaking and, for that reason, we include them both in our index. The Cronbach Alpha for the local level index is 0.907,while for the national trust is 0.919.Neighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 649\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Presstrust questions about national and subnational institutions: our factor analysis shows that the\\nquestion on national and European parliaments (the first two questions) load in a different dimen-sion, compared to the sub-national ones (regional, provincial, and local authorities), which are\\npart of another dimension (for more details see the discussion of the results in the Appendix,\\nSection 5, Figure 15A). The second factor analysis adds to the picture the questions about trust\\nin non-governmental nationwide institutions, the judiciary and the police. This factor analysisshows that while justice loads –although with a relatively poor factor loading –in the second\\ndimension, trust in police loads in a third dimension. Thus, even when including all political insti-\\ntutions, we detect two dimensions, one related to local trust, the other related to national trust (formore details see the Appendix, Section 5, Figure 16A). Thus, the first empirical test reassures us\\nthat it is worth distinguishing local trust and national trust.\\nIndependent variables\\nOur main independent variables, which we labelled as neighbourhood decay and periphery, are\\ntwo different additive indexes. To measure perceived periphery, we rely on additive indexes mea-\\nsuring how peripheric the place of living is according to respondents ’perceptions. The index is\\ncomposed of seven questions (Cronbach Alpha 0.9). Respondents were asked to what extent theyfind it difficult reaching the following services: pharmacy, emergency room, kindergarten, localmarkets, postal office, municipal office, and police station. The levels range from ‘no difficulties at\\nall’to‘a lot of difficulties ’. As for the neighbourhood decay, the index is composed of eight ques-\\ntions (Cronbach Alpha 0.8). Respondents were asked to what extent the following aspects arepresent in the neighbourhood: uncleaned streets, air pollution, crime, bad street lighting, traffic,\\nbad smell, noise, parking difficulties. The levels range from ‘not at all ’to‘a lot ’.\\nTo control the effects of our main predictors on local and national trust, we include variables\\nrelated to the different ‘capitals ’of respondents (i.e., economic, social, and cultural). Economic\\ncapital is measured as an additive index comprising of three questions (Cronbach Alpha 0.7)\\nrelated to family income situation, the economic resources of the family, and the satisfaction\\nof the personal economic situation (see the Appendix for the wording).\\nSecondly, cultural capital is built as an additive index comprising of three questions related to\\nhow frequently interviewees went to the cinema, theatre, museum/exhibition in the last year.\\nThese are ordinal variables, with five levels ranging from ‘never ’to‘more than 12 times ’. This\\nmeasure is in line with our definition of cultural capital as a broader concept compared to formaleducation. However, we are also aware that education is most notably used to measure cultural\\ncredentials of individuals. Therefore, we always use education as a control variable.\\nFinally, we include an additive index to measure the social capital, which is composed of four-\\nteen questions (Cronbach Alpha 0.7). We provide a broad definition of social capital to tap all\\ndimensions related to this multifaceted concept: the first dimension concerns political participa-\\ntion for which we include four variables. Respondents were asked whether they took part in suchactivities in the last 12 months. The second dimension relates to civil society participation, whichincludes questions about participation in different types of associations ’meetings, volunteering for\\none of these associations, and donating money. The third dimension is related to work participa-\\ntion, which includes questions about participation in trade unions ’meetings, professional asso-\\nciations, volunteering for a trade union.\\nSociodemographic controls include age (cardinal), gender (1 = Female), and education.\\nEducation is an ordinal variable, going from 1 ( ‘Lower than high school ’)t o4( ‘Tertiary ’). We\\nalso include a variable for political interest, which is an additive index (Cronbach Alpha 0.75)of two variables measuring respectively the frequency of political information and political dis-\\ncussion (1 = ‘Everyday ’;6= ‘Never ’). We control for the political interest of respondents, since, as\\nwe specified also above, it is a relevant source of political trust (Catterberg and Moreno, 2006 ). To\\naccount for the overall economic condition of the respondent we add a control for employment650 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressstatus (1 = ‘Employed ’). Finally, we also include two regional-level variables as further controls:\\nthe GDP per capita and the unemployment rate in 2017. Unfortunately, the dataset does notinclude provincial/municipality-level identifiers so we could not include more refined data on this\\naspect. We include these two regional-level variables to control for Type 1 causal mechanisms, for\\nwhich, among other factors, trust is linked to the economic performance of a country (a region inthis case).\\nAll the descriptive statistics of our independent and dependent variables are presented in the\\nAppendix, Section 2.\\nModelling\\nWe opt for a multivariate multilevel model, in which individuals are clustered in regions (20 + 1,\\nsee below). This N is not unreasonably low, even if we acknowledge its potential limitations when\\nit comes to maximum likelihood estimation (Stegmueller, 2013 ). We include all twenty Italian\\nregions plus another category, which includes ‘other ’responses. This is a very marginal category\\n(N = 138, 0.3% of our sample): even when removing it, the results do not change. In this case, for\\nregional-level variables we input the regional-level score for the GDP per capita and unemploy-ment (for the category ‘other ’, we input the national mean). We first create two different models,\\nin which we change the dependent variable (local and national trust). Second, we estimate a set of\\ninteractive models in which we test whether economic, cultural, and social capitals modify the\\neffects of both perceived neighbourhood decay and periphery. We report in the main text theFigures with the main effects, while full model specifications are available in the Appendix(Section 3, Tables 2A,4A,5A,6A).\\nDiscussion\\nLocal and national trust explained\\nFigure 1, Panel A, shows that all variables identified by the literature as potential drivers of insti-\\ntutional trust are indeed significant in the expected direction, when it comes to local trust. The\\nmost relevant independent variable is the neighbourhood decay, which is negatively related tolocal trust (b = −0.16, P<0.001); thus, the more people perceive that the quality of life of their\\nneighbourhood is low, the higher is the distrust in local institutions. Also, our periphery index\\nproves to be significant and negative, so the more people perceive that the local services providedby the public authority are far away from their place of living, the lower is the institutional trust(b =−0.019, P<0.001). Local trust, thus, is apparently related to both socio-economic status\\nFigure 1. The determinants of local (Panel A) and national (Panel B) trust. Note: *** P<0.001; ** P<0.01; * P<0.05.Neighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 651\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Press(economic, cultural, and social capital) and to the way people perceive that the local institution is\\ndelivering for them. Overall, without rejecting the classical explanations for trust in local authori-ties, we also find confirmation for our hypotheses 1.1. and 1.2.\\nIn addition, the economic capital is the variable with the second strongest predicting power in\\nthe model (b = 0.147, P<0.001), but also the cultural (b = 0.015, P<0.001) and social capital\\n(b = 0.04, P<0.001) contribute to local institutional trust. The only exception to this trend is edu-\\ncation, which has a negative and significant effect (although it should be made clear once again\\nthat the effect of education can meaningfully go in both directions).\\nThe fact that local and national trust do not follow the exact same logic is apparent when look-\\ning at Figure 1, Panel B, reporting the results of our regression analysis for national trust.\\nFocussing on our main independent variables,\\n4the results show that periphery is no longer sig-\\nnificant, while neighbourhood decay is still significant at P<0.001 level, albeit its effect decreases\\nby two-thirds (but remains amongst the most powerful predictors). In this sense, respondents\\nmight perceive local authorities as responsible for providing the basic services and, thus, target\\nthe local institutions as the main ones that are responsible for (not) providing them. Thisblame/reward attribution does not translate plainly into the national institution, though. So,\\nthe local institutions are perceived as responsible for providing close-to-home basic public serv-\\nices, not the national ones. However, the quality of the neighbourhood in which respondents livedoes affect national trust. The results hold when switching our dependent variable from a single\\nitem to the two composite indexes for local and national trust (see Table 3Ain the Appendix).\\nOur main independent variables, and in particular neighbourhood decay, were never tested\\nbefore, so we advance a potential explanation, which is related to the fact that being socialized\\nin a neighbourhood with a lower quality of life has a more profound impact on respondents ’eval-\\nuations of the political institutions as such, if compared with the perceived functioning of publicservices. The quality of the surroundings of respondents can be the very first ‘political ’evaluation\\nthat individuals make about the role of the institutions in general: regardless of the distance of\\nbasic services, living in a neighbourhood where the perceived problems make the quality of lifelower might push respondents to lose confidence not just in what local authorities do, but in insti-tutions in general. We thus find strong empirical confirmation of hypothesis 1.4., while we reject\\nhypothesis 1.3.\\nIndividual capitals as moderators of neighbourhood decay and periphery\\nIn this section we test hypotheses 2.1., 2,2., and 2.3., for which economic, cultural, and social cap-itals moderate the effects of our main independent variables on local and national trust. We tested\\nthese moderating effects by interacting the three measures for individuals ’capitals with our indi-\\ncators of neighbourhood decay and periphery. The results of these analyses are visible in Figures 2,\\n3, and 4, where we plot the estimated coefficients of neighbourhood decay and periphery on local/\\nnational trust at different levels of economic, cultural, and social capital (fully specified models areavailable in Tables 4A,5A,6Aof the Appendix). Overall, counter to our hypotheses, we observe\\nthat, the negative effect of neighbourhood decay on both local and national trust increases when\\neconomic and social capital increase as well. The only exception is related to the moderating effectof cultural capital. In this case we find (consistently this time with our hypotheses) that when\\ncultural capital increases, the negative effect of decay on local trust decreases, while it remains\\nalmost the same when national trust is considered. This might suggest that, contrary to ourexpectations, people who are endowed with richer capitals might be more affected by neighbour-\\nhood decay because they are more equipped to recognize the inability of both local and national\\ninstitutions to deliver a better quality of life. We find a similar, yet not identical, trend when con-sidering perceived periphery. With the exception of the moderating effect of economic capital, we\\n4It is worth noting here that education is significant, but changes direction.652 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressobserve that those who do have higher cultural and social capital are more negatively affected by\\nperceived periphery compared to those who have low cultural and social capital.\\nAll this given, these interaction effects proved to be by no means statistically significant, with\\nthe only (partial) exception of the cultural capital which is significant at P<0.01 for neighbour-\\nhood decay and at P<0.05 for periphery at the local level (the results are robust when using the\\ntwo indexes of local and national trust as dependent variables, see Appendix, Section 4, Figures\\nfrom 3Ato14A).5Thus, the results go against our hypotheses 2.1., 2,2. and partially against 2.3.,\\nmeaning that individual assets and resources of the respondents do not mitigate the effect of theperceived neighbourhood decay and periphery on their trust in local and national institutions. In\\nother words, no matter how wealthy, and well-connected people are, where they think they live is\\nin itself a good indicator of the level of trust they have in institutions.\\nConclusion\\nThis paper proposed a different theoretical perspective for interpreting institutional trust in local(and national) institutions among citizens. We focussed on the effect of an under-analysed factor,i.e., perceived quality of life. Based on our theoretical argument, we distinguished two aspects of\\nquality of life, which, although related, should be treated separately, as our findings show. On the\\nFigure 2. Effects of Neighbourhood decay and Periphery by levels of Economic capital on Local Trust (top-right and top-left\\nplots) and on National Trust (bottom-right and bottom-left plots).\\n5Note that, although the interaction coefficients for cultural capital and neighbourhood decay and periphery are significant\\nfrom a statistical point of view, an accurate inspection of the margins plot reveals that these effects are not robust. These\\nfindings are confirmed also when using as dependent variables the indexes of local and national trust (see Appendix,\\nTables 7A,8A,9A): the only exception is the significance of the interaction between cultural capital and periphery (with\\nap<0.05). However, also in this case, these effects are not robust (See Appendix, Section 4).Neighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 653\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressone hand the perceived neighbourhood decay, which is aimed at measuring how individuals eval-\\nuate the environment in which they live and are socialized; on the other, individuals ’perceived\\nperiphery, which is related to the perceived distance of citizens from services.\\nWe believe that this paper provided a useful contribution for three different reasons. Firstly, it\\nempirically offers new indicators that go beyond classic subjective policy-output perceptions of\\ncitizens in evaluating local institutional trust: in this regard, our indicators move in the intersec-\\ntion of cultural and institutional approaches, highlighting the importance of keeping both into\\nconsideration when analysing institutional trust. Our results show also that local and national\\ntrust are at least partially different ‘objects ’: even though the perceived quality of the surrounding\\nis amongst the most relevant factors that is associated with trust in local and national institutions,\\nwe also show that output-oriented indicators related to the peripherality of the neighbourhood\\nhave an effect on the local trust only. Finally, and related to the previous point, it provided evi-\\ndence that the quality of the surrounding is so relevant that it is not conditioned by the embedded-\\nness of the single citizen in the society.\\nTrying to reconnect these findings with the existing literature on the differences between\\nnational and local trust, it seems to us that the institutional salience and differentiation approaches\\nhave both their own merits. In line with the differentiation approach, the evaluation of local public\\nservices is associated with trust in local institutions, but it does not affect national trust (i.e., citi-\\nzens rationally evaluate local institutions on their own merits). However, we also do find impor-tant overlapping between the two types of trust, as suggested by the institutional salience\\napproach: aside from socio-demographic variables, neighbourhood decay has an effect on trust\\nat both levels, thus suggesting that the quality of life in the neighbourhood is more than a mere\\nevaluation of a (local) public service and targets a more pervasive malaise. One of the important\\nFigure 3. Effects of Neighbourhood decay and Periphery by levels of Social capital on Local Trust (top-right and top-left\\nplots) and on National Trust (bottom-right and bottom-left plots).654 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressadvancements of our paper lies exactly on this finding: while the differentiation approach has\\nfocussed exclusively on the impact of national level evaluations on local trust, our paper shows\\nthat local evaluations matter for national trust as well, meaning that where you live explains how\\nmuch you trust local and national institutions.\\nWe believe that our theoretical framework and our empirical findings can be a useful tool to\\nincrease our knowledge on the sources of institutional trust: similar operationalizations of our\\nvariables in other contexts might confirm (or disconfirm) what we have found for Italy. We don ’t\\nknow whether the effects of quality of life on local trust vary depending on the institutional setting\\nof the country. Italy is in between a federal structure and a fully centralized one, with a certaindegree of autonomy granted to local governments, but also with a quite strong central state. One\\nmight hypothesize that the effect of our key predictors on trust in local institutions could be stron-\\nger in federal states (or in states with strong local governments), as in these contexts citizens could\\nmore easily identify local authorities as responsible for their own malaise. Conversely, the same\\nvariables could have a stronger effect on trust in national institutions in cases of strongly central-\\nized states. Although we have no answer for now to these questions, we believe that our contri-\\nbution represents a starting point to develop further research. Finally, these findings might be ofinterest for policy-makers and policy-analysts: in an era of democratic malaise, our paper shows\\nthat one way (not the only one) to improve citizens ’trust in political institutions (be these local or\\nnational) is to take particular care of the context in which citizens live. This is because institutions\\nwhich deliver at the local level make citizens more trustful about them\\nSupplementary material.

The literature has dealt\\nmainly with the former, while less attention has been given to the latter. This paper advances a noveltheoretical approach to inquire about trust in local institutions, which is also used to test national ones.We posit that trust is affected by the perceptions individuals have of the physical space where they live.Both a) the perceived quality of life in the neighbourhood where individuals live and b) the neighbour-hood (perceived) peripherality are hypothesized to af fect trust in local (and to a lesser extent) national\\ninstitutions. We test our hypotheses in Italy, over a large representative sample of more than 40.000\\nrespondents. We show that both variables are crucial predictors of local trust, but only the perceivedquality of life predicts national tru st. Equally important, social, cultu ral and economic individual capital\\ndoes not modify the relation.\\nKeywords: local trust; national trust; periphery; quality of life; multilevel analysis\\nIntroduction\\nSince the seminal work by David Easton on systems analysis ( 1965;1975), the study of support for\\nand trust in institutions in democratic systems has been key for political scientists. This is because\\ntrust in institutions is crucial for the stability of democratic regimes and, more generally, for the\\noverall health of a democracy (Braithwaite and Levi, 1998; Hetherington, 1998; Misztal, 1996;\\nWarren, 1999). Understandably, the vast majority of the scholarly literature has concentrated its\\nefforts in studying institutional trust at the national level, given the key relevance of national govern-\\nments in policymaking. However, in the last decades, central governments have devolved relevant\\nshares of their competences to regional and local authorities (Jennings, 1998;H o o g h e et al.,2010):\\nlocal governments have become so relevant (Weitz-Shapiro, 2008; Tang and Huhe, 2016)t h a ts e v -\\neral studies both in advanced and developing countries (Chanley, Rudolph and Rahn, 2000;\\nChristensen and Lægreid, 2005; Cleary and Stokes, 2006; Cordova and Layton, 2016;U s l a n e r ,\\n2018; Zmerli and Van der Meer, 2017;W o l a k , 2020) now acknowledge that trust in and support\\nfor local governments is at least as relevant as trust in national institutions.\\nNevertheless, comparatively less attention has been devoted to trust in local institutions\\n(Christensen and Lægreid, 2005 ; Rahn and Rudolph, 2005 ; Kelleher and Wolak, 2007 ; Cleary\\nand Stokes, 2006 ; Wolak, 2020 ). This is unfortunate, since the literature has underlined that there\\nare good reasons to analyse trust in local and national institutions as two separate objects (startingfrom the fact that local and national trust follow different patterns, with the former being higher\\ncompared to the latter, Fitzgerald and Wolak, 2016 ).\\n© The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of European Consortium for Political Research.European Political Science Review (2023), 15, 641 –658\\ndoi:10.1017/S1755773923000140\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University PressIn this respect, several contributions show that when differentiating between local and national\\ntrust, citizens focus on the performance of each institution (Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Van Elsas,\\n2015 ;M u ˜noz, 2017 ). However, the literature has so far focussed mainly on the relationship\\nbetween (objective) institutional performances (measured in terms of provision of local services)\\nand trust (Stein et al.,2021 ). In this paper, we advance a different and original perspective on the\\nstudy of trust in local institutions which looks at the effect on local trust of the perceptions that\\ncitizens have about the quality of life in their neighbourhoods.\\nBorrowing from Huckfeldt ’s(1986 ) intuition which suggests that the perceptions individuals\\nhave of their everyday life in their local space (i.e., their neighbourhoods) is crucial in shaping their\\npolitical attitudes and behaviours, we conceive the quality of life in the neighbourhood as encom-passing two conceptually distinguished factors: on the one hand, the perceived neighbourhood\\ndecay, which refers to the perception that individuals have about the physical space of the neigh-\\nbourhood in which they live; and, on the other, the perceived periphery, which is related to howfar essential public services are perceived to be from the individual ’s neighbourhood. Both forms\\nof neighbourhood discontent are then hypothesised to negatively affect trust in local institutions.\\nAlthough our locally based predictors are primarily hypothesised to affect trust in local insti-\\ntutions, we also elaborate on the (untested) idea that local level issues could also act as potential\\ndrivers of trust in national institutions. We deem this aspect to be a further innovative contribu-\\ntion of this paper. Indeed, while the existing literature has worked on the effect of national level\\nvariables on trust in local institutions, no paper has inquired so far whether and to what extent\\nlocal level determinants affect trust in national institutions.\\nTo test our framework, we rely on an individual level survey of Italian citizens provided by the\\nItalian National Institute of Statistics-ISTAT (approximately 40.000 respondents). Employing a\\nseries of multilevel regression models, our results prove that both perceived periphery and neigh-\\nbourhood decay are amongst the most powerful predictors of trust in local institutions (and, to a\\nlesser extent, of national ones). Furthermore, we find that the relevance of these new predictors is\\nnot conditioned by economic, social, and cultural capital.\\nThe sources of institutional trust\\nPolitical trust is generally defined as ‘a basic evaluative orientation towards the government\\nfounded on how well the government is operating according to people ’s normative expectations ’\\n(Hetherington, 1998 , p. 791). The literature that tries to explain the sources of trust and distrust is\\nabundant (Levi and Stoker, 2000 ; Bertsou, 2019 ) and it has provided very different explanations of\\ntrust in institutions. In this section, we summarize this literature in order to provide a general\\nframework, which we then use as a point of departure for a more specific analysis of trust in insti-\\ntutions at both the local and national levels.\\nIn their famous contribution, Mishler and Rose ( 2001 ) distinguish between the cultural and\\ninstitutional approach to the study of trust. Cultural approaches posit that the origin of political\\ntrust is exogenous to the political system and is mostly connected to the early socialization ofindividuals: ‘from birth, individuals learn to trust or distrust other people by experiencing\\nhow others in the culture treat them and how, in return, others react to their behavior ’\\n(Mishler and Rose, 2001 , p.34). This is a process that begins within families, and it is then\\nextended to interactions and connections with other socializing agents (schools, pairs, etc.). As\\nindividual networks expand, people tend to increase their trust in other people (Brehm and\\nRahn, 1997 ). This reciprocal trust is at the core of Putnam ’s social capital ( 1993 ,2000 ) (i.e., vol-\\nuntarism, membership in associations, extensive social networks, etc.). Social capital produces a\\ncivic culture whose values of interpersonal, social, and institutional trust are transmitted from642 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressgeneration to generation (Almond and Verba, 1989 ; Putnam et al., 1993 ; Putnam 2000 ). So, for\\ncultural approaches, interpersonal trust is positively connected with institutional trust.1\\nThe institutional approach, on the other hand, frames trust in institutions as politically endog-\\nenous (Mishler and Rose, 2001 ), meaning that it depends on the (perceived) capacity of the politi-\\ncal system and its political institutions to perform in a satisfactory way. In other words, trust in\\ninstitutions is generated within the political system and depends on the performance of political\\ninstitutions.\\nBoth cultural and institutional approaches have been articulated along two dimensions, i.e.,\\nmacro and micro. Macro cultural approaches to institutional trust have mostly focussed on under-\\nstanding how societies, characterised by different levels of interpersonal trust, also differ in terms\\nof trust in institutions. However, while societies with a strong civic culture have, on average, higher\\nlevels of institutional trust, ‘socialization into a culturally homogenous society nonetheless allows\\nsubstantial variation among individuals ’(Mishler and Rose, 2001 , p.35). To account for the differ-\\nences between individuals, cultural approaches have thus also focussed on the effect of individualsocio-demographic characteristics on trust in institutions (i.e., micro cultural approaches to insti-\\ntutional trust). In this vein, age, social class, income, cognitive ability, and education have been\\nwidely analysed (Rohrschneider and Schmitt-Beck, 2002 ; Campbell, 2004 ; Christensen and\\nLægreid, 2005 ; Anderson and Singer, 2008 ; Jennings et al .,2009 ; Hakhverdian and Mayne,\\n2012 ; Gustavsen et al.,2017 ; Holmberg et al.,2017 ). The results of this literature proved to be\\nmixed, meaning that the conventional wisdom for which highly sophisticated individuals with\\na high socio-economic-status trust more in institutions is true, although results vary a lot acrosscountries and political contexts (Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Dalton, 2004 ; Holmberg et al.,2017 ).\\nJust to give an example, education is negatively related to institutional trust in corrupt societies,\\nbut the sign of the relation is reversed in clean societies (Hakhverdian and Mayne, 2012 ).\\nMoreover, the literature has shown the importance of attitudes and psychological traits, such\\nas internal efficacy, the big five personality traits, ideological orientations, and interest in politics\\n(Newton, 2001 ; McLaren, 2011 ; Holmberg et al.,2017 ; Ackermann et al.,2019 ).\\nOn a different note, macro institutional approaches have focussed on the effect on trust of those\\naggregate-level variables measuring the objective performance of institutions: GDP growth and\\nlevels of unemployment are the usual suspects, even though the significance of these variables\\nand their direction is disputed (Chanley et al.,2000 ; Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Van der Meer,\\n2010 ; Wolak, 2020 ). Other scholars have also focussed on the level of corruption, institutional\\ntransparency, and political scandals, showing that corruption and lack of transparency under-mines institutional trust (Chanley et al .,2000 ; Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Andersen and\\nTverdova, 2003 ; Morris and Klesner, 2010 ; Van der Meer, 2010\\n; Hakhverdian and Mayne,\\n2012 ; Grimmelikhuijsen et al. ,2013 ).\\nThe micro level approach, instead, has focussed on individual perceptions of country- or local-\\nlevel performances, showing that subjective economic evaluations are more powerful predictors of\\ninstitutional trust than objective ones and that sociotropic evaluations are more relevant than ego-\\ntropic ones (Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Dalton, 2004 ; Wroe, 2016 ). More recent studies have also\\nshown that individual perceptions of economic insecurity (mainly due the negative effects of de-\\nindustrialization, technological change, and de-unionization, see Wroe, 2016 ) have a negative\\neffect on institutional trust. Other works have looked at the perception of public services offeredby the institutions. These studies concentrate mainly on the local level (Kelly and Swindell, 2002 ;\\nBouckaert and van de Walle, 2003 ; Downe et al.,2013 ; Ellinas and Lamprianou, 2014 ) and use\\nsatisfaction with services such as education, health, transportation, bureaucracy or local council-\\nlors ’ethical behaviour as explanatory variables for the support of institutions. Other indicators\\n1Nonetheless, several studies (Brehm and Rahn, 1997 ; Knack, 2003 ; Bekkers, 2012 ; van Ingen and Bekkers, 2015 ) have\\npartially challenged this perspective, showing that the causal direction goes from institutional trust to social trust, whereasthe reverse causal effect is limited.Neighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 643\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressprove to be equally important, i.e., process and probity (Citrin and Stoker, 2018 ). Here the idea is\\nthat when citizens deem the institutional processes to be fair and public officials are considered to\\nbe honest, institutional trust increases (Borre and Andersen, 1997 ). Overall, the literature shows\\nthat both subjectively- and objectively-measured performance matters (e.g., DeHoog et al.,1990 ;\\nFitzgerald and Wolak, 2016 ). To the extent local and national institutions (are perceived to)\\ndeliver, support for these institutions increases as well.\\nWhile both approaches to institutional trust (i.e., cultural and institutional) provide fruitful\\ninsights on the drivers of support for institutions, our contribution to the study of local (and\\nnational) trust takes the micro-level institutional approach as a point of departure, although,as we shall see, in fact, it goes beyond it. Local trust (as a form of specific support) has been mainly\\nanalysed considering local institutions as service providers and citizens as service consumers who\\nevaluate institutional performances and, as a consequence, either trust or distrust the institutions\\n(Kelly and Swindell, 2002 ; Bouckaert and van de Walle, 2003 ; Gustavsen et al.,2017 ; Christensen\\net al.,2020 ). However, local public services, in our understanding, represent just a narrow con-\\nception of local institutions ’performances. In this regard, the literature has given scant attention\\nto one possible crucial aspect, that is the role played by broader perceptions of quality of life inlocal communities, something that we discuss in the next section.\\nPerceived physical environment as a determinant of institutional trust\\nAs stated above, the literature on local trust has focussed mainly on the relationship between theprovision of (local) services and trust (Stein et al.,2021 ). Only very recently, McKay et al.(2021 )\\nintroduced perceived social marginality and perceived economic deprivation in their analysis of\\npolitical trust. We partly change the perspective, shifting our focus from individual economic sta-tus to the perceptions that citizens have about the quality of life in the neighbourhood. We intend\\nthe latter as a more encompassing phenomenon compared to the perceived quality of public serv-\\nices or the perceived social and economic deprivation. Under the label of quality of life, we include\\ntwo concepts: first, the perception of well-being in the neighbourhood, referring to the perceptions\\nabout the quality of the physical space where individuals live (hereafter, neighbourhood decay).\\nSecond, the more service-oriented concept of periphery, i.e., how distant individuals perceive they\\nare from basic public services (hereafter, periphery). Notice that our focus here is on the percep-tions of individuals. Indeed, while objective measures of individual distance could be a good proxy\\nfor marginality, it is also important to highlight that they are not able to capture the quality of life\\nin the neighbourhood. It is possible that individuals live relatively (and objectively) close to public\\nservices, but still the quality of life in the neighbourhood is not perceived in positive terms.\\nIn both cases, the mechanism that might link perceived physical space in the neighbourhood\\nand institutional trust is analogous. On the one hand, people perceiving the place they live as far-\\naway from the ‘centre ’, not just in terms of physical distance, but also in terms of public services\\nprovision, might feel abandoned by the local authorities and, if this effect goes beyond the local\\nlevel, by the national authorities as well. The literature has already shown, in this regard, the\\nimportance of developing individual place attachment to revitalise the neighbourhood (Brown\\net al.,2003 ). On the other, if individuals perceive a low level of general well-being in the neigh-\\nbourhood, they might consider the institutions as incapable of delivering results. In our under-standing, the two mechanisms should be kept separate as they capture two distinct aspects of\\nurban life, which do not necessarily coexist. A clear example here is the emergence of completely\\nnew neighbourhoods around shopping centres and malls, in a process of reconfiguration of public\\nspaces that involves both advanced and developing countries. Separated from the city centres,\\nmalls are by now considered by many as new contemporary squares (Staeheli and Mitchell,\\n2006 ), and it is exactly around these contemporary squares that new forms of urban aggregation\\nemerge. Responding to the needs of providing a reassuring environment to consumers, these new644 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressurban spaces are kept clean and tidy (Staeheli and Mitchell, 2006 ). Yet, the organisation of essen-\\ntial services takes time. And, as people are attracted by the initially low prices for housing and rentsin these new neighbourhoods, these spaces become rapidly populated, but often not sufficiently\\nserved by public services. Thus, despite the absence of urban decay, citizens living in these places\\ntend to be disconnected from city centres.\\nMore in detail, for us periphery is the perceived distance of individuals from basic and essential\\nservices, such as hospitals, supermarkets, and drugstores. In this respect, while we cannot assume\\na priori that closer public services would be better than public services located far away from the\\nplace of living, having them close means at least that local communities try to connect the area and\\nto provide a specific service. Also, while the extent to which an individual belongs to a peripheryhas been measured through the distance from the capital or to the ‘centre ’of a specific area\\n(Wolak, 2020 ), we believe that a ‘subjective ’perception of periphery should better capture feelings\\nof disconnection from real (or imagined) urban, political, and social centres. In this perspective,the perceived distance from basic services assumes the symbolic meaning of exclusion.\\nAs stated above, the perceived distance from public services is not necessarily related to the\\nwell-being in the neighbourhood. Nonetheless, well-being in itself has been seldom analysed inthe literature. Even though the recent literature has shown a connection between (perceived) localgovernment performance and trust in local institutions (with citizens being capable of properly\\njudging the performance of public services) (Van Ryzin, 2007 ), these studies have focussed on\\nspecific public policy outcomes and their relationship with good governance (Bouckaert andvan de Walle, 2003 ), rather than on the quality of the individuals ’surrounding environment.\\nMore recent contributions show the importance of the centre-periphery cleavage in shaping trust\\n(Mitsch et al.,2021 ). Well-connected areas that took advantage of globalisation sharply differ from\\nleft-behind areas (post-industrial cities and suburban communities), where globalisation impactednegatively on the quality of life and social division from the ‘centre ’grew exponentially (Jennings\\nand Stoker, 2017; 2016 ): the reaction against the mainstream is evident in these areas (Rodríguez-\\nPose, 2018 ). Physically measured periphery, measured as the distance from the capital, is also\\nnegatively connected with trust in politicians, according to a recent study (Stein et al.,2021 ).\\nAll this given, to build our theoretical argument we move from the intuition by Huckfeldt\\n(1986 ), who stressed the critical relevance of neighbourhood contexts in forging individuals ’polit-\\nical attitudes and behaviours. In this respect, the empirical literature has abundantly demonstratedthat neighbourhood perceptions are linked to a number of attitudes and behaviours (Ellaway et al.,\\n2001 ), place attachment (Brown et al.,2003 ), and social capital (Kleinhans et al.,2007 ) amongst\\nothers. Individual life trajectories within the neighbourhood are not built in a vacuum, but within\\na physical space which inevitably affects how individuals perceive the context in which they liveand how they perceive themselves within this context.\\nOn this backdrop, we argue that liveable areas, i.e., non-polluted areas, with low levels of crime,\\nlow traffic, clean spaces, new roads etc., should reinforce trust in institutions, as citizens can eval-uate on a daily basis the responsiveness of the local community to an individual ’s basic needs.\\nCitizens living in such areas have the possibility to see with their eyes if the local community\\nis able to deliver.\\nThus, we posit that the perception of the surroundings is the closest proxy citizens have to\\nevaluate the performance of local community officials, and thus a potential key driver of supportfor local government. As Pfeiffer and Cloutier ( 2016 , pp. 270 –272) show in their review essay,\\nthere is a growing body of literature suggesting that the physical characteristics of a neighbour-\\nhood (housing design, street connectivity, availability of public spaces, perceived personal security,green areas) may lead to more or less social engagement, and ultimately, happiness. According to\\nMorris ( 2019 ), it is subjective well-being that is the main component that distinguishes suburbs\\nand cities, other conditions being almost similar. Thus, while it is true that the ‘revenge of the\\nplaces that don ’\\nt matter ’(Rodríguez-Pose, 2018 ) is related to policy outputs, such as income\\ninequality, it is also true that it is fostered by subjective perceptions of the physical space in whichNeighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 645\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressindividuals live, i.e., through the personal evaluation of being (not) part of the places excluded\\nfrom public services and forgotten by local politics.\\nOur main assumption is that perceptions of marginality and abandonment might spur distrust\\nin those institutions that, for proximity reasons, might be more easily identifiable as responsible\\nfor (and thus blamed for) such malaises. Furthermore, while the quality of life can reasonably\\naffect trust in local institutions, we cannot exclude that these perceptions may also produce var-\\niations in trust in national institutions as well. In particular, as long as neighbourhood contexts\\ncontribute both to the socialization of individuals and to forge their political attitudes and behav-\\niours, the experience and perceptions of such neighbourhoods might well be connected to moregeneral attitudes towards national politics. After all, the neighbourhood defines the breeding\\nground where political and social interactions occur in the first place, and where community\\nbonds are constructed (Putnam, 2000 ). To the extent these physical spaces are perceived as dete-\\nriorated, the quality of social interactions as well as the general levels of interpersonal and insti-\\ntutional trust might be negatively affected. For example, as Cohen and Dawson ( 1993 ) have\\nshown, among African Americans, that social isolation produced by neighbourhood decay tends\\nto alienate this group from politics, making them less likely to participate.\\nIn this respect, our argument differs from the existing literature since we problematize the rela-\\ntionship between individuals ’perception of their surrounding and the evaluation of institutions ’\\nperformance. On the one hand, from a rational choice perspective, citizens reward or punish insti-\\ntutions, which are responsible for providing specific services and improve the quality of the neigh-\\nbourhood. On the other hand, it might be equally true that the perception of the surroundings, inwhich the political socialization of the individuals occurs, is so pervasive that individuals translate\\nthis blaming mechanism to the national level as well. As a consequence, while the literature so far\\nhas looked at national level performances as partially responsible for the levels of trust locally, we\\nwant to explore whether the quality of life in the neighbourhood is responsible for national level\\ntrust. Or, to the opposite, all performances confined to the local level do not affect national trust,\\nas individuals separate between the spheres of influence of the institutions and thus correctly\\nblame/reward only the institution responsible for delivering a specific public service. We acknowl-edge that these mechanisms might not be the same across individuals (see e.g., Proszowska et al.,\\n2023 ;M u ˜noz, 2017 ): for example, less educated individuals could be more likely to blame both\\ngovernmental levels for their perceived marginality, being basically less likely to clearly attribute\\nresponsibility to (and thus blame) one or the other level of government. However, our main goal is\\nto check whether the quality of life in the neighbourhood (in its twofold specification, i.e., neigh-\\nbourhood decay and periphery) affects local trust primarily (and national trust secondarily).\\nDifferent twins? Local and national trust in comparison\\nSo far, our argument has been based on the implicit assumption that trust in local and national\\ninstitutions are different twins. This assumption, however, needs to be justified. The literature\\nanalysing commonalities and differences between trust in local and national institutions can\\nbe organised along the lines of two different approaches. On the one hand, a strain of the literature\\ntreats trust as a ‘monolithic ’bloc: citizens do not have the cognitive skills to differentiate between\\nlocal and national institutions (Sniderman, 1993 ; Denters, 2002 ) and they express their attitudes\\ntowards the (perceived) most relevant institution, usually the national institution, and then trans-\\nlate this attitude towards other institutional levels (we refer to this approach as the institutional\\nsalience approach) (e.g., Proszowska et al.,2023 ).\\nOn the other hand, other authors argue that citizens differentiate across different tiers of gov-\\nernments, although through different mechanisms (we refer to this approach as the differentiationapproach). Within this approach, proximity theories, for example, maintain that closeness to insti-\\ntutions matters, as closer institutions are considered by citizens as more reliable and trustworthy646 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Press(Proszowska et al.,2023 ; Denters and Klok, 2013 ; Hansen, 2013 ). Re-elaborating the paradox of\\ndistance stated by Frederickson ( 1997 ), Christensen and Laegrid ( 2005 , p. 488) claim that ‘[w]\\nhereas people trust government officials who are nearby, they believe the government officials\\nwho are far away are lazy, incompetent and probably dishonest ’. According to others, instead,\\ndifferentiation across institutional levels is produced by rational evaluations of citizens, who assess\\nthe performance of different institutions on their own merits (e.g., Mishler and Rose, 2001 ; Van\\nElsas, 2015 ;M u ˜noz, 2017 ). In this perspective, both national and local trust are forms of specific\\nsupport, mostly determined by how well/bad the citizens evaluate the performance of different\\ninstitutions. Wolak ( 2020 ) for example, shows that trust in state government in the USA is asso-\\nciated with the character and performance of the state government, rather than being derived from\\ntrust in national institutions. Similarly, Steenvoorden and van der Meer ( 2021 , p. 9), focussing on\\nthe Dutch case, concludes that ‘local political performance matters for local political support ’,\\nalthough a certain degree of overlap between trust in local and national institutions do in fact exist.\\nThis review suggests that while the more general support of national institutions affects local\\ntrust, the latter is influenced by the performance of the local institutions, and as such, should be\\nanalysed separately from national trust. In addition, while the differentiation between local andnational trust is theoretically sound, it also offers to us the chance to test whether and to what\\nextent our indicators of the quality of life in neighbourhoods affect not only local trust but also\\nnational trust. This is, in our perspective, a further innovative aspect of this paper. Indeed, while\\nthe literature has mostly focussed on the effect of national trust on local trust, in fact, assessing\\nhow the performance of national institutions might affect trust in local institutions, we test here\\nthe potential inverse relationship, that is to say the impact of local determinants on trust in\\nnational institutions.\\nHypotheses\\nGiven our emphasis on the relevance of subjective perceptions of the places in which individuals\\nlive, our first hypothesis clearly connects local institutional trust to perceived neighbourhood con-\\nditions. As argued above, more intense feelings of peripherality and urban decay might be linked\\nto the inefficiency of local institutions to respond to the citizens ’needs. We thus hypothesise that:\\n1.1 The higher the perceptions of periphery of the neighbourhood and (1.2) the higher the per-\\nceptions of the neighbourhood ’s decay, the lower the trust in local institutions.\\nAlthough responsibility for neighbourhood decay and marginality can be more easily attributed to\\nlocal governments (which are the closest level of government to local communities and thus more\\neasily identifiable), it is not possible to exclude that the perception of the quality of life in the\\nneighbourhood might be then reflected into more general feelings of distrust in the overall\\nnational system. As we argued above, as neighbourhood contexts contribute to the formation\\nof political attitudes and behaviours, the experience and perceptions of such neighbourhoods\\nare hypothesised to be connected also to more general attitudes towards national politics. For\\nexample, research on the surge of protest and populist votes has widely shown that (objectiveand subjective) conditions of deprivation at the local level are associated with better electoral per-\\nformances of protest and populist parties, which often mobilised voters on an anti-systemic rhet-\\noric (Schulte-Cloos and Leininger, 2022 ). On this basis, we hypothesise that:\\n1.3 The higher the perceptions of periphery of the neighbourhood and (1.4) the higher the per-\\nceptions of the neighbourhood ’s decay, the lower the trust in national institutions.Neighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 647\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University PressWhile we posit that neighbourhood decay and periphery have a negative effect both on local and\\nnational trust, we also expect that our focal predictors should have stronger effects on local trust.\\nThis is because, based on our theoretical argument, both perceived neighbourhood decay and\\nperiphery should be primarily connected to individual experiences with local institutions.\\nAlso, we advance further expectations about possible interactive mechanisms with other pre-\\ndictors. We take into consideration here whether individual resources mitigate the negative effects\\nof the perceived environment. We do so by leveraging the CARs (i.e., capitals, assets and resour-\\nces) approach to social stratification and borrowing from the simple intuition according to which\\nindividuals enter the social life with ‘different endowments, capacities and resources ’(Savage,\\n2015 , p. 49), which are inherited from their past and produce either constrictions or enhanced\\nopportunities for their future. We assume that individual resources (and agency) might allow citi-\\nzens to experience, in a differentiated way, the everyday complexities associated with a peripheral\\nand/or decayed physical environment.\\nIn line with Savage and colleagues (Savage et al., 2005 ), we posit that three different types of\\nindividual resources (i.e., capitals) can differentiate the way in which citizens experience their\\nphysical environment and, as a consequence, their level of trust in political institutions. These\\nare: economic, cultural, and social capital. Economic capital refers to the overall wealth of indi-\\nviduals and it broadly indicates how far individuals are from material needs (Savage, 2015 ).\\nCultural capital broadly concerns cultural credentials that individuals can leverage in society.\\nIt refers to formal education, but also to tastes and interests, that are either socially approved\\nor disapproved of (i.e., socially legitimated) (Savage, 2015 , p. 92). In particular, the concept of\\ncultural capital encompasses broad cultural tastes and interests which are a revealing symbol\\nof an individual ’s position in society. As the literature does not agree on the role of education\\nin reinforcing institutional trust, with a higher level of education both acting as a driver for trust\\nin institutions but also for distrust in institutions, we rather investigate the role of cultural capital\\nwhile controlling for the education level of individuals, given its great social equalizer role.\\nFinally, social capital relates to human and socially relevant relations that generally produce\\npositive effects. Putnam et al., (1993 ) and Putnam ( 2000 ) refers to social capital as an asset fos-\\ntered by civic engagement and extensive social networks that are able to produce positive effects\\nboth at personal and social level. It thus refers to the extension and density of social networks,\\nwhich enormously affect individuals ’life chances. As Savage puts it (2015, p. 52) ‘contacts can\\naccumulate over time and may be a resource which can be mobilized to gain information about\\njobs, accommodations, exciting opportunities and so forth ’. Social connections are therefore\\nresources that structure opportunities in society.\\nIn general, our expectation is that those who are endowed with a high economic, cultural, and\\nsocial capital, even if living in a peripheral and decayed neighbourhood, can still leverage theirmaterial and immaterial resources to overcome systemic inefficiencies. To give few straightfor-\\nward examples: lack of public transportation can be overcome by using private cars or paying\\nfor a cab; people with a higher level of sophistication might find it easier to have information\\nto reduce the material and immaterial distance with the centre (cultural capital); people with high\\nsocial capital, can rely on large networks of friends for personal (emotional) and material (eco-\\nnomic) support; and they are more likely to be informed about chances and opportunities within\\nthe neighbourhood (but also outside it).\\nWe thus formalise the following hypotheses:\\n2. Higher levels of (2.1) economic, (2.2) social, and (2.3) cultural capital reduce the negative\\nimpact of perceived neighbourhoods ’periphery and decay on institutional trust (both local and\\nnational).648 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University PressData and methods\\nCase study and data sources\\nWe test our hypotheses focussing on a peculiar case study, Italy. This is a country with one of the\\nlowest levels of trust in national institutions in Western Europe and the country where Putnamet al., (1993 ) proposed his argument about social trust and on how democracy could perform\\nbetter when individuals trust each other and participate in public life. Despite this work, there\\nare no studies that focus on this context of the relation between the individual perception ofthe physical space and local (and national) institutional trust. We believe that, despite their limited\\ngeneralisability, discussing our hypotheses in relation to the Italian case is interesting in itself.\\nFirst, because of the lack of recent studies on the sources of variation in institutional trust in thiscountry; and second, because of the originality of our argument. We point out here that whileprevious studies focussed on the perception of public services and objective distance from city\\ncentres to capture the malaise of individuals, we make a step forward. We posit that, on the\\none hand, the perception of the environment in which citizens live cannot be simply relatedto the (perceived) quality of services, as life in neighbourhoods implies a broader set of interac-tions with the physical space. On the other, we maintain that the perceived peripherality of the\\nneighbourhood is something to be analysed separately from the perception of neighbour-\\nhood decay.\\nGiven the novelty of the theoretical approach to the study of trust, fine-grained data are needed\\nto test our hypotheses. From this point of view, Italy represents a unique opportunity, given the\\nlarge amount of individual-level data measuring perceived marginality and decay of neighbour-hoods in exceptionally large-N datasets which are provided by the Italian National Institute ofStatistics (ISTAT). We rely here on survey data gathered under the project ‘Aspects of daily life ’\\nin 2017.\\n2This is one of the largest surveys available for Italy and it covers the resident population\\nin private households, by interviewing through P.A.P.I. technique a range of 20.000 –50.000 indi-\\nviduals. Our samples vary from 41.108 to 41.127 respondents.\\nDependent variables\\nThe dependent variables are two questions on local and national trust. For national trust, we focuson a question on trust in National Parliament (as a robustness check we replicated the model usingas a dependent variable an additive index, which includes a question on the trust in the European\\nParliament besides the National Parliament, see below). For trust in local government, we rely on a\\nspecific question related to trust in local authorities (as robustness checks we replicated the modelusing as a dependent variable an additive index, which includes questions on the trust in provin-cial and regional governments, see the online Appendix, Section 1. The robustness checks are in\\nline with the findings presented in the main text, see Appendix, Section 3).\\n3. As mentioned earlier,\\nthere are good theoretical reasons for expecting local trust and national trust to behave differently:albeit a partial overlap is possible, the two concepts are not identical and the drivers for both\\nsources of trust might be different according to the literature. To empirically show that local\\nand national trust do not necessarily move together, we run two factor analyses in which weinclude all trust-related questions included in our survey. The first factor analysis includes five\\n2Data available at: https://www.istat.it/en/archivio/129959\\n3Beside the theoretical aspect, which we already discussed in the previous paragraph, and the empirical aspect that we\\nexplained in the following paragraph, we opted for these indices as a robustness check because of our research questions:as our focus is on the trust in institutions, we believe that for local trust an additive index can better capture the overall\\nsatisfaction with the performance of all institutions involved in policy making at the local level. In the Italian case, specific\\nlocal services (e.g., public schools or health services) are not managed solely by local institutions, but also by provinces and\\nregions. The same goes with trust in national institutions: both the national and European parliament are responsible for the\\npolicymaking and, for that reason, we include them both in our index. The Cronbach Alpha for the local level index is 0.907,while for the national trust is 0.919.Neighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 649\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Presstrust questions about national and subnational institutions: our factor analysis shows that the\\nquestion on national and European parliaments (the first two questions) load in a different dimen-sion, compared to the sub-national ones (regional, provincial, and local authorities), which are\\npart of another dimension (for more details see the discussion of the results in the Appendix,\\nSection 5, Figure 15A). The second factor analysis adds to the picture the questions about trust\\nin non-governmental nationwide institutions, the judiciary and the police. This factor analysisshows that while justice loads –although with a relatively poor factor loading –in the second\\ndimension, trust in police loads in a third dimension. Thus, even when including all political insti-\\ntutions, we detect two dimensions, one related to local trust, the other related to national trust (formore details see the Appendix, Section 5, Figure 16A). Thus, the first empirical test reassures us\\nthat it is worth distinguishing local trust and national trust.\\nIndependent variables\\nOur main independent variables, which we labelled as neighbourhood decay and periphery, are\\ntwo different additive indexes. To measure perceived periphery, we rely on additive indexes mea-\\nsuring how peripheric the place of living is according to respondents ’perceptions. The index is\\ncomposed of seven questions (Cronbach Alpha 0.9). Respondents were asked to what extent theyfind it difficult reaching the following services: pharmacy, emergency room, kindergarten, localmarkets, postal office, municipal office, and police station. The levels range from ‘no difficulties at\\nall’to‘a lot of difficulties ’. As for the neighbourhood decay, the index is composed of eight ques-\\ntions (Cronbach Alpha 0.8). Respondents were asked to what extent the following aspects arepresent in the neighbourhood: uncleaned streets, air pollution, crime, bad street lighting, traffic,\\nbad smell, noise, parking difficulties. The levels range from ‘not at all ’to‘a lot ’.\\nTo control the effects of our main predictors on local and national trust, we include variables\\nrelated to the different ‘capitals ’of respondents (i.e., economic, social, and cultural). Economic\\ncapital is measured as an additive index comprising of three questions (Cronbach Alpha 0.7)\\nrelated to family income situation, the economic resources of the family, and the satisfaction\\nof the personal economic situation (see the Appendix for the wording).\\nSecondly, cultural capital is built as an additive index comprising of three questions related to\\nhow frequently interviewees went to the cinema, theatre, museum/exhibition in the last year.\\nThese are ordinal variables, with five levels ranging from ‘never ’to‘more than 12 times ’. This\\nmeasure is in line with our definition of cultural capital as a broader concept compared to formaleducation. However, we are also aware that education is most notably used to measure cultural\\ncredentials of individuals. Therefore, we always use education as a control variable.\\nFinally, we include an additive index to measure the social capital, which is composed of four-\\nteen questions (Cronbach Alpha 0.7). We provide a broad definition of social capital to tap all\\ndimensions related to this multifaceted concept: the first dimension concerns political participa-\\ntion for which we include four variables. Respondents were asked whether they took part in suchactivities in the last 12 months. The second dimension relates to civil society participation, whichincludes questions about participation in different types of associations ’meetings, volunteering for\\none of these associations, and donating money. The third dimension is related to work participa-\\ntion, which includes questions about participation in trade unions ’meetings, professional asso-\\nciations, volunteering for a trade union.\\nSociodemographic controls include age (cardinal), gender (1 = Female), and education.\\nEducation is an ordinal variable, going from 1 ( ‘Lower than high school ’)t o4( ‘Tertiary ’). We\\nalso include a variable for political interest, which is an additive index (Cronbach Alpha 0.75)of two variables measuring respectively the frequency of political information and political dis-\\ncussion (1 = ‘Everyday ’;6= ‘Never ’). We control for the political interest of respondents, since, as\\nwe specified also above, it is a relevant source of political trust (Catterberg and Moreno, 2006 ). To\\naccount for the overall economic condition of the respondent we add a control for employment650 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressstatus (1 = ‘Employed ’). Finally, we also include two regional-level variables as further controls:\\nthe GDP per capita and the unemployment rate in 2017. Unfortunately, the dataset does notinclude provincial/municipality-level identifiers so we could not include more refined data on this\\naspect. We include these two regional-level variables to control for Type 1 causal mechanisms, for\\nwhich, among other factors, trust is linked to the economic performance of a country (a region inthis case).\\nAll the descriptive statistics of our independent and dependent variables are presented in the\\nAppendix, Section 2.\\nModelling\\nWe opt for a multivariate multilevel model, in which individuals are clustered in regions (20 + 1,\\nsee below). This N is not unreasonably low, even if we acknowledge its potential limitations when\\nit comes to maximum likelihood estimation (Stegmueller, 2013 ). We include all twenty Italian\\nregions plus another category, which includes ‘other ’responses. This is a very marginal category\\n(N = 138, 0.3% of our sample): even when removing it, the results do not change. In this case, for\\nregional-level variables we input the regional-level score for the GDP per capita and unemploy-ment (for the category ‘other ’, we input the national mean). We first create two different models,\\nin which we change the dependent variable (local and national trust). Second, we estimate a set of\\ninteractive models in which we test whether economic, cultural, and social capitals modify the\\neffects of both perceived neighbourhood decay and periphery. We report in the main text theFigures with the main effects, while full model specifications are available in the Appendix(Section 3, Tables 2A,4A,5A,6A).\\nDiscussion\\nLocal and national trust explained\\nFigure 1, Panel A, shows that all variables identified by the literature as potential drivers of insti-\\ntutional trust are indeed significant in the expected direction, when it comes to local trust. The\\nmost relevant independent variable is the neighbourhood decay, which is negatively related tolocal trust (b = −0.16, P<0.001); thus, the more people perceive that the quality of life of their\\nneighbourhood is low, the higher is the distrust in local institutions. Also, our periphery index\\nproves to be significant and negative, so the more people perceive that the local services providedby the public authority are far away from their place of living, the lower is the institutional trust(b =−0.019, P<0.001). Local trust, thus, is apparently related to both socio-economic status\\nFigure 1. The determinants of local (Panel A) and national (Panel B) trust. Note: *** P<0.001; ** P<0.01; * P<0.05.Neighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 651\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Press(economic, cultural, and social capital) and to the way people perceive that the local institution is\\ndelivering for them. Overall, without rejecting the classical explanations for trust in local authori-ties, we also find confirmation for our hypotheses 1.1. and 1.2.\\nIn addition, the economic capital is the variable with the second strongest predicting power in\\nthe model (b = 0.147, P<0.001), but also the cultural (b = 0.015, P<0.001) and social capital\\n(b = 0.04, P<0.001) contribute to local institutional trust. The only exception to this trend is edu-\\ncation, which has a negative and significant effect (although it should be made clear once again\\nthat the effect of education can meaningfully go in both directions).\\nThe fact that local and national trust do not follow the exact same logic is apparent when look-\\ning at Figure 1, Panel B, reporting the results of our regression analysis for national trust.\\nFocussing on our main independent variables,\\n4the results show that periphery is no longer sig-\\nnificant, while neighbourhood decay is still significant at P<0.001 level, albeit its effect decreases\\nby two-thirds (but remains amongst the most powerful predictors). In this sense, respondents\\nmight perceive local authorities as responsible for providing the basic services and, thus, target\\nthe local institutions as the main ones that are responsible for (not) providing them. Thisblame/reward attribution does not translate plainly into the national institution, though. So,\\nthe local institutions are perceived as responsible for providing close-to-home basic public serv-\\nices, not the national ones. However, the quality of the neighbourhood in which respondents livedoes affect national trust. The results hold when switching our dependent variable from a single\\nitem to the two composite indexes for local and national trust (see Table 3Ain the Appendix).\\nOur main independent variables, and in particular neighbourhood decay, were never tested\\nbefore, so we advance a potential explanation, which is related to the fact that being socialized\\nin a neighbourhood with a lower quality of life has a more profound impact on respondents ’eval-\\nuations of the political institutions as such, if compared with the perceived functioning of publicservices. The quality of the surroundings of respondents can be the very first ‘political ’evaluation\\nthat individuals make about the role of the institutions in general: regardless of the distance of\\nbasic services, living in a neighbourhood where the perceived problems make the quality of lifelower might push respondents to lose confidence not just in what local authorities do, but in insti-tutions in general. We thus find strong empirical confirmation of hypothesis 1.4., while we reject\\nhypothesis 1.3.\\nIndividual capitals as moderators of neighbourhood decay and periphery\\nIn this section we test hypotheses 2.1., 2,2., and 2.3., for which economic, cultural, and social cap-itals moderate the effects of our main independent variables on local and national trust. We tested\\nthese moderating effects by interacting the three measures for individuals ’capitals with our indi-\\ncators of neighbourhood decay and periphery. The results of these analyses are visible in Figures 2,\\n3, and 4, where we plot the estimated coefficients of neighbourhood decay and periphery on local/\\nnational trust at different levels of economic, cultural, and social capital (fully specified models areavailable in Tables 4A,5A,6Aof the Appendix). Overall, counter to our hypotheses, we observe\\nthat, the negative effect of neighbourhood decay on both local and national trust increases when\\neconomic and social capital increase as well. The only exception is related to the moderating effectof cultural capital. In this case we find (consistently this time with our hypotheses) that when\\ncultural capital increases, the negative effect of decay on local trust decreases, while it remains\\nalmost the same when national trust is considered. This might suggest that, contrary to ourexpectations, people who are endowed with richer capitals might be more affected by neighbour-\\nhood decay because they are more equipped to recognize the inability of both local and national\\ninstitutions to deliver a better quality of life. We find a similar, yet not identical, trend when con-sidering perceived periphery. With the exception of the moderating effect of economic capital, we\\n4It is worth noting here that education is significant, but changes direction.652 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressobserve that those who do have higher cultural and social capital are more negatively affected by\\nperceived periphery compared to those who have low cultural and social capital.\\nAll this given, these interaction effects proved to be by no means statistically significant, with\\nthe only (partial) exception of the cultural capital which is significant at P<0.01 for neighbour-\\nhood decay and at P<0.05 for periphery at the local level (the results are robust when using the\\ntwo indexes of local and national trust as dependent variables, see Appendix, Section 4, Figures\\nfrom 3Ato14A).5Thus, the results go against our hypotheses 2.1., 2,2. and partially against 2.3.,\\nmeaning that individual assets and resources of the respondents do not mitigate the effect of theperceived neighbourhood decay and periphery on their trust in local and national institutions. In\\nother words, no matter how wealthy, and well-connected people are, where they think they live is\\nin itself a good indicator of the level of trust they have in institutions.\\nConclusion\\nThis paper proposed a different theoretical perspective for interpreting institutional trust in local(and national) institutions among citizens. We focussed on the effect of an under-analysed factor,i.e., perceived quality of life. Based on our theoretical argument, we distinguished two aspects of\\nquality of life, which, although related, should be treated separately, as our findings show. On the\\nFigure 2. Effects of Neighbourhood decay and Periphery by levels of Economic capital on Local Trust (top-right and top-left\\nplots) and on National Trust (bottom-right and bottom-left plots).\\n5Note that, although the interaction coefficients for cultural capital and neighbourhood decay and periphery are significant\\nfrom a statistical point of view, an accurate inspection of the margins plot reveals that these effects are not robust. These\\nfindings are confirmed also when using as dependent variables the indexes of local and national trust (see Appendix,\\nTables 7A,8A,9A): the only exception is the significance of the interaction between cultural capital and periphery (with\\nap<0.05). However, also in this case, these effects are not robust (See Appendix, Section 4).Neighbourhood decay, periphery, and trust in political institutions 653\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressone hand the perceived neighbourhood decay, which is aimed at measuring how individuals eval-\\nuate the environment in which they live and are socialized; on the other, individuals ’perceived\\nperiphery, which is related to the perceived distance of citizens from services.\\nWe believe that this paper provided a useful contribution for three different reasons. Firstly, it\\nempirically offers new indicators that go beyond classic subjective policy-output perceptions of\\ncitizens in evaluating local institutional trust: in this regard, our indicators move in the intersec-\\ntion of cultural and institutional approaches, highlighting the importance of keeping both into\\nconsideration when analysing institutional trust. Our results show also that local and national\\ntrust are at least partially different ‘objects ’: even though the perceived quality of the surrounding\\nis amongst the most relevant factors that is associated with trust in local and national institutions,\\nwe also show that output-oriented indicators related to the peripherality of the neighbourhood\\nhave an effect on the local trust only. Finally, and related to the previous point, it provided evi-\\ndence that the quality of the surrounding is so relevant that it is not conditioned by the embedded-\\nness of the single citizen in the society.\\nTrying to reconnect these findings with the existing literature on the differences between\\nnational and local trust, it seems to us that the institutional salience and differentiation approaches\\nhave both their own merits. In line with the differentiation approach, the evaluation of local public\\nservices is associated with trust in local institutions, but it does not affect national trust (i.e., citi-\\nzens rationally evaluate local institutions on their own merits). However, we also do find impor-tant overlapping between the two types of trust, as suggested by the institutional salience\\napproach: aside from socio-demographic variables, neighbourhood decay has an effect on trust\\nat both levels, thus suggesting that the quality of life in the neighbourhood is more than a mere\\nevaluation of a (local) public service and targets a more pervasive malaise. One of the important\\nFigure 3. Effects of Neighbourhood decay and Periphery by levels of Social capital on Local Trust (top-right and top-left\\nplots) and on National Trust (bottom-right and bottom-left plots).654 Davide Angelucci and Davide Vittori\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1755773923000140  Published online by Cambridge University Pressadvancements of our paper lies exactly on this finding: while the differentiation approach has\\nfocussed exclusively on the impact of national level evaluations on local trust, our paper shows\\nthat local evaluations matter for national trust as well, meaning that where you live explains how\\nmuch you trust local and national institutions.\\nWe believe that our theoretical framework and our empirical findings can be a useful tool to\\nincrease our knowledge on the sources of institutional trust: similar operationalizations of our\\nvariables in other contexts might confirm (or disconfirm) what we have found for Italy. We don ’t\\nknow whether the effects of quality of life on local trust vary depending on the institutional setting\\nof the country. Italy is in between a federal structure and a fully centralized one, with a certaindegree of autonomy granted to local governments, but also with a quite strong central state. One\\nmight hypothesize that the effect of our key predictors on trust in local institutions could be stron-\\nger in federal states (or in states with strong local governments), as in these contexts citizens could\\nmore easily identify local authorities as responsible for their own malaise. Conversely, the same\\nvariables could have a stronger effect on trust in national institutions in cases of strongly central-\\nized states. Although we have no answer for now to these questions, we believe that our contri-\\nbution represents a starting point to develop further research. Finally, these findings might be ofinterest for policy-makers and policy-analysts: in an era of democratic malaise, our paper shows\\nthat one way (not the only one) to improve citizens ’trust in political institutions (be these local or\\nnational) is to take particular care of the context in which citizens live. This is because institutions\\nwhich deliver at the local level make citizens more trustful about them\\nSupplementary material.

Whilesome citizens and political interests blamed the EU forthe problems caused by the economic crisis, a decline intrust in national governments was also apparent. \\nBased on analysis of data from the European Quality of\\nLife Survey (EQLS) and Eurobarometer studies, thisreport seeks to broaden the understanding of trends intrust in institutions. The focus is on patterns of changesince the turn of this century, and possible explanationsfor these patterns at national and EU level. The reportalso seeks to identify the societal groups for whom trusthas declined the most, paying particular attention tothe relationship between confidence in nationalinstitutions and in the EU. Finally, it examines theimplications for policy of changes in trust.\\nPolicy context\\nDeclining trust in institutions is problematic for severalreasons. Trust partly reflects good institutionalperformance; it is also an essential precondition foreffective governance. Trust in governmental institutionscan increase compliance with regulations. Trust ingovernment authorities increases willingness to paytaxes, and may enable authorities to implementstructural reforms with short-term costs, but long-termbenefits. In countries where trust in institutions islimited, citizens might prioritise political candidateswho promise immediate benefits, creatingopportunities for populist and radical parties andpoliticians, whose promised quick fixes may not actuallysolve complex problems.\\nKey findings\\nSince 2001 there has been no uniform tendency ofdeclining trust in national institutions in Member States.Data from the EQLS suggest that, in many countries,decline in trust in institutions was a temporaryphenomenon during the recession. Meanwhile, trust inthe EU remained generally greater than trust in nationalgovernments in most countries during the crisis period. Trust in national institutions was generally more volatilein southern and eastern Europe, and more stable inwestern and northern Europe and in the Baltic States.In general, trust in national institutions had fullyrecovered for most of the EU by 2016; however, in anumber of countries, such as some southern MemberStates, it has not returned to precrisis levels. Lowerlevels of trust still characterise a number of easternEuropean countries.\\nTrust in national political institutions was most affected\\nby the crisis. Changes in trust in non-politicalinstitutions (legal system and police) as well as in mediawere smaller.\\nBetween 2001 and 2016, trust in the EU institutions also\\ndeclined but, in most countries, it is still greater than intrust in national governments. The relationshipbetween trust in national institutions and trust inEU institutions is generally positive: an increase in trustin national institutions is linked with an increase intrusting in EU institutions. In some countries, however,trust in the EU declined more significantly during thecrisis years than trust in national governments –a possible blame-shifting effect.\\nThe uneven distribution of trust within countries\\n(trust inequality) has generally not changed over time.However, during the crisis, people in low-statuspositions experienced a greater decline in trust innational institutions. And levels of trust recovered moreamong those who were positive about the quality ofpublic services. \\nDecrease in trust may be less problematic if it is not a\\npart of democratic disengagement and politicalcynicism. In eight Member States, political participationactually increased among those with low trust inpolitical institutions. In the majority of countries,however, political participation either declined orremained at the same levels among those who tend notto trust political institutions.\\nThere is increasing concern also about the potential rise\\nin income inequalities, as well as the polarisation ofsociety. This report examined how differences betweenupper- and lower-middle classes changed over time.Between 2007 and 2011, polarisation between themiddle income quartiles in terms of overall trust ininstitutions occurred in six countries, with levelsdeclining more among those in the lower-middleincome quartile and less in the upper-middle incomequartile. Between 2011 and 2016, there was a greaterincrease in trust among those in the upper-middleincome quartile in four countries.Executive summary2Policy pointers\\n£ Despite worries over declining trust in public\\ninstitutions, it seems that the erosion of publicconfidence is not irreversible. However, as trustdynamics differ considerably across countries,measures appropriate to specific contexts have tobe sought.\\n£ Understanding the drivers of trust is key to devisingappropriate measures that can boost trust levels. \\n£ Improving macroeconomic performance andincreasing incomes are important ways of boostingtrust; however, monetary improvements are not theonly factor. Institutional integrity as evidenced byperception of low corruption helps to sustain trust,while failure to curtail corruption is associated witha decline in trust.\\n£ Addressing the quality of public services is a keymeans of boosting overall trust in institutions. Thepublic services in question include health and careservices – a broader set of services to the publicthan the direct functions of national politicalinstitutions.£ Moderating societal tensions and reducing feelingsof social exclusion can help prevent a decline intrust.\\n£ Monitoring the extent of political participation anddisengagement among groups who display limitedtrust can give policymakers useful information increating opportunities for dialogue betweencitizens and institutions. \\n£ At individual level, education is an important factor:people with higher levels of education generallyhave more confidence in public institutions,including EU institutions. Countries or groups insociety with a lower level of education therefore areimportant priorities when designing and targetingpublic awareness programmes, nationally or withthe EU institutions in mind.\\n£ Trust in public institutions brings a number ofpositive practical consequences. The extent of taxevasion is lower in countries with greater trust inpolitical institutions. Trust in institutions predicts asupportive attitude to policy reforms, includingpolicies of EU-level relevance, such as the singlecurrency, common foreign and defence policy, andenlargement. Societal change and trust in institutions3The decade since the Great Recession has been\\ncharacterised by critics as a period of ‘crisis of trust’ inEuropean societies (Hosking, 2017). Following theeconomic crisis that hit Europe in 2008, whengovernments struggled to curb unemployment, managepublic debt and emerge from the economic downturn,trust in national political institutions fell in manycountries. The crisis also had an effect on trust in EUinstitutions. \\nIn the European context, the erosion of trust in\\ninstitutions has given rise to questions about thepotential impact on political and social stability, as wellas implications for the development of Europeanintegration. Some blamed the EU for the problemscreated by the economic crisis that affected citizens.However, a decline in trust in national governments wasconsiderable; in fact, trust in the EU generally remainedgreater than trust in national governments in most EUMember States during the crisis period. \\nThe decline in trust in institutions was partly due to the\\neconomic crisis itself. The 2008 recession brought abouthigher levels of unemployment, increasingprecariousness and declining real incomes in a majorityof Member States. The consequences of this economiccrisis have shaped the perceptions of institutionalperformance among the populations affected(Eurofound, 2013b). Young people and those living insouthern European Member States were particularlyaffected during this period (Eurofound, 2017; Medgyesi,2018). Controversies over the management of theeconomic crisis also had a negative impact onconfidence in national and EU institutions. For instance,severe austerity measures introduced in severalMember States greatly constrained the potential forgovernments to redress the negative social impacts ofthe crisis. \\nHowever, the economic crisis was not the only\\nchallenge national and EU institutions faced. They werealso presented with other societal challenges such asthe consequences of globalisation, increased incomeinequality, and changes in attitudes and values insociety. In western European countries, globalisationand extensive immigration put pressure on the labourmarket position of the lower-middle class. Increasinginequality, in particular the growing incomes of therichest social strata, also deepened the social divide andincreased tensions in many countries (Nolan andWhelan, 2014; Tóth et al, 2014). Changes in societalvalues may also have contributed to the decline in trustin institutions: it is possible that increasingindividualisation resulted in a decline of collectiveengagement among citizens, as well as an increase incritical attitudes towards mainstream politics and‘business-as-usual’. \\nWhile much of the damage to trust in institutions could\\nthus be attributed to the global economic crisis, it isimportant to consider whether there are longer-termtrends or alternative explanations that could helpunderstanding. Key stakeholders want to know how theinstitutional system is performing from the point of viewof citizens, and how trust in this relationship can bebuilt or restored. It is important to examine the extentto which trends in trust are nationally specific and towhat extent there are overarching similarities related tothe social changes that are occurring across countries;for example, changes in values and a decline incollective engagement, or, in contrast, the rise of acritical citizenry whose low trust does not necessarilyinfer disengagement.\\nFindings from research in social and political science\\nindicate that in many countries at various points intime, people in disadvantaged situations (for instance,low income, unemployment or low education,sometimes combined with older age) have had lesstrust in institutions. There is also a growing body ofresearch about quality of governance that highlights theimportance of institutional performance generally aswell as of perceptions of transparency and fairnessmore specifically. One of the major Eurofound findingsin connection with trust in institutions relates to thelarge positive impact that the perceived quality ofpublic services makes on trust in institutions(Eurofound, 2012, further corroborated in this report). \\nIn the current report, Eurofound seeks to broaden the\\nunderstanding of trends in trust in institutions in the EUand their relation to societal changes. The research alsoseeks to characterise the groups in society with greateror lesser trust in institutions and to consider whypatterns of trust have changed over time.\\nDeclining trust in institutions is problematic for several\\nreasons. Although trust in institutions is partly a resultof good institutional performance, it is also an essentialprecondition for good and efficient governance (OECD,2013). Trust in government authorities can improvecompliance with rules and regulations and reduce thecost of enforcement. People will comply with rules ifthey see regulations as fair and legitimate and trust thelegal system and the authorities involved (Jackson et al,2011). Trust increases willingness to pay taxes. Publictrust in the government may also help authorities toimplement structural reforms that have short-termcosts but long-term benefits. In countries characterised\\nIntroduction4as having low trust in institutions, citizens prioritise\\npolitical candidates who promise immediate benefits.This creates opportunities for populist and radicalparties and politicians to rapidly gain popularity bycriticising established policies and promising quick fixesto solve complex problems (Morales, 2017).\\nThis report examines the dynamics of trust in\\ninstitutions since the beginning of the 21st century.After reviewing the literature on trust in institutions inthe next chapter, the key findings of the research arepresented in the following chapter. Firstly, the reportoutlines the trends in trust in institutions in differentMember States as well as in country groups. Theanalysis presents trends in trust at both the nationaland EU levels, including those in relation to specificinstitutions. Secondly, the report studies the differencesbetween social groups in terms of trust dynamics. Thisfocuses on social groups according to demographic andsocioeconomic factors, but also based on factorsrelated to social cohesion (such as perception of socialtensions, social exclusion and political participation) aswell as perceived quality of public services. Afterdescribing the dynamics of trust in institutions amongvarious social groups, multivariate statistical methodsare applied to find potential correlations betweenchanges in trust in institutions considering bothindividual-level and macro-level factors. Finally, thereport presents the findings on the consequences ofchanges in trust in institutions.\\nSocietal change and trust in institutions5This chapter provides an overview of the scholarly\\nliterature on the nature, the roots and policyconsequences of trust in institutions. After clarifying theconcept of trust, the chapter presents the mostimportant findings on trust in institutions, which isgenerally understood to mean confidence in nationalpolitical institutions (such as government orparliament), non-political institutions (such as thepolice and the courts) and other non-state institutions(such as the media). However, trust in the EU has been asubject of growing research interest, in particular sincethe UK’s decision to leave the EU in 2016, commonlyknown as Brexit. This chapter reviews a number ofrecent studies on the origins and dynamics of trust in EUinstitutions.\\nDefinitions of trust\\nTrust is a complex phenomenon, which makes itdifficult to define. According to a generally accepteddefinition, trust is an expectation that the object of trust(for example, a person or an institution) will producepositive outcomes (Levi and Stoker, 2000). Trust orconfidence is therefore viewed as an attitude (thisreport uses the terms ‘trust’ and ‘confidence’interchangeably). \\n[Trust] is a more or less lasting view held about someobject, event or person(s) in the outside world. It is aframe of mind, outlook or perspective whichinfluences one’s behaviour or one’s disposition to actor think in certain ways. The same is true of distrust.Attitudes are not unchangeable, but they are also notmomentary, as feelings may be. Viewed as anattitude, it makes sense to ask questions about trustin opinion polls. \\n(Hosking, 2017)\\nOver the past two decades, the study of trust ininstitutions has received increasing attention, catchingup with the extensive research on social (orinterpersonal) trust that took off in the early 1990s.Social or interpersonal trust concerns trust betweenindividuals, while trust in institutions is defined asconfidence in state organisations (e.g. parliament,government, the police or the courts) or non-stateorganisations (e.g. media, non-governmentalorganisations (NGOs), churches or corporations).The interest in researching trust is driven by anacknowledgement that it is a powerful indicator ofwell-being, both at the individual and the societal level,as well as a fundamental condition of collective actionand cooperation (Kahan, 2001; Tyler, 2011; Eurofound,2013a; OECD, 2013). \\nThe trust of citizens in public institutions is regarded as\\na measure of support for, or legitimacy of, the politicalsphere (Levi and Stoker, 2000). However, the kind ofsupport that trusting attitudes express is an issue ofdebate. Some scholars argue that public trust asmeasured by survey questions means the specificsupport given to the incumbent government, andtherefore bears no relation to the general legitimacy ofthe political system (Citrin, 1974; Citrin and Green,1986). Trust can decrease and then increase again, andeven a long-term decline in public confidence (as hasbeen observed in the US in the past decades) need notnecessarily be a concern because it does not threaten toundermine the legitimacy of democratic polity.\\nHowever, others have found empirical evidence that\\ntrust is related to both specific and diffuse support(Miller, 1974; Miller and Listhaug, 1990). The notions ofspecific and diffuse support were developed by DavidEaston (Easton, 1965). Diffuse support is the acceptanceor general legitimacy of a system as such, while specificsupport relates to the incumbent and individual-levelsatisfaction with the performance of the government.The general support for a system might be high even ifpeople are dissatisfied with governmental performanceor leading politicians lose their legitimacy, for instance,because of political scandals. Conversely, the systemmight be illegitimate, while some politicians or publicinstitutions may enjoy widespread popularity andsupport. Easton himself associated public trust with thenotion of diffuse support, although he alsoacknowledged that elements of specific and diffusesupport are difficult to discern in practice (Easton,1975). However, using empirically based arguments,Hetherington (1998) argues that trust actually affectsboth specific and diffuse support. Trust has been shownto be a dynamic phenomenon (Hetherington, 2005), sothere is a risk that a vicious circle may develop in whichlow trust and poor governmental performance mutuallyreinforce each other, leading to overall dissatisfactionwith the political system.1Policy context and literature\\nreview   6The above considerations illustrate the point that trust\\nin institutions should be regarded as a phenomenonthat is\\n£ complex\\n£ differentiated\\n£ context-dependent\\n£ dynamic \\nThis is also the approach endorsed by the presentreport.\\nComplexity of the phenomenon\\nTrust is a complex phenomenon: hence, it is difficult todefine precisely what the display of trust in institutionsmay be expressing. Trust is linked to expectations aboutthe future – that a given actor (institution, person etc.)will produce positive outcomes (Levi and Stoker, 2000).However, trust depends on a number of factors:\\n£ rational (for example, based on previousexperience)\\n£ emotional (rooted in the character of the trustingperson or the appealing features of the person orentity who is trusted, etc.) \\n£ moral (for example, evaluating the fairness of thesituation)\\n£ individual (stemming from the given person’ssocialisation or community membership, etc.)\\n£ macro-level (involving the pervasiveness of normcompliance in a society)\\nTrust attitudes may reflect satisfaction, optimism,legitimacy perceptions, and so on. For more on thefactors affecting trust, see Campbell (2004), Tyler(2006b), Levi et al (2009), Marien and Hooghe (2011),Newton and Zmerli (2011), Eurofound (2013b), Medve-Bálint and Boda (2014) and Becker et al (2016).\\nThe complexity of the phenomenon has a number of\\nimplications. First, while in general it is assumed that agreater level of trust is preferable, this is not necessarilythe case in all situations, just as low trust is not always aconcern. A high level of trust in institutions may implyuncritical attitudes towards politics and even reducethe political interest and activity of citizens, while adiminishing level of trust may be a warning signal oferoding legitimacy (Butler et al, 2016). Second, given thecomplexity inherent in trust attitudes and the tendencyfor trust to create positive feedback loops, establishingcausal relationships between trust and other factors isespecially challenging. Regardless of the difficulty indistinguishing causes and effects, there is evidence ofpositive association between trust in institutions andother measures of institutional quality, as well asquality of life. In this context, quality of life includes thequality of public services, the quality of democracy,control of corruption, income, satisfaction with life,and income equality. These correlations present a goodreason for policy actors to take account ofdevelopments in trust in society.\\nDifferentiation of trust relations\\nGiven the complexity of the phenomenon of trust, it isadvisable to differentiate among specific trust relations.Aggregated trust indicators and average values mayhide meaningful differences among the trustingattitudes of social groups whose compositional logicextends beyond the usual demographic variables(like age, gender or education level) as well asconfidence in different institutions with differentsociopolitical functions. Some institutions, like thegovernment, are held responsible for the challengesfaced by society, while others, like the courts, arejudged more in the light of normative values(Grosskopf, 2008). Trust in some institutions may bemore politicised and express general legitimacyattitudes, while confidence in other institutions maystem from personal experience and be moreoutcome-oriented. These differences may havepractical policy implications when it comes to measuresfor increasing trust. Trust research so far has focusedmainly on a few institutions, for instance, politicalinstitutions, courts and police, and tax authorities(see Chanley et al, 2000; Murphy, 2004; Rudolph, 2009;Hawdon, 2008; Jackson et al, 2011; Győrffy, 2012), butthere is still a lack of systematic comparisons betweendifferent types of institutions. Similarly, little attentionhas been devoted so far to examining the different trustpatterns of specific social groups.\\nImportance of context dependency\\nAs implied in the previous section, trust in institutions ishighly context dependent. Patterns of trust vary acrossdifferent social, institutional, political or culturalcontexts. This fact has been acknowledged in theliterature (see Zmerli and Hooghe, 2011); however, adeeper understanding could and should be developedin this respect. As Bradford et al (2014) note (specificallyconcerning trust in police), most existing researchapplies to a limited context because the bulk ofscholarly work has been conducted in Anglo-Saxon andwestern European countries. This observation is alsotrue on a more general scale, and is therefore applicableto other fields of research on trust in institutions. Forinstance, there is surprisingly little literature providingcomparisons of the patterns of trust in institutions ofthe newer democracies of eastern and central Europe tothose of older Member States, especially in terms ofmore recent developments.\\nDynamic nature of trust \\nThe complexity and context dependence of trust ininstitutions makes it a dynamic phenomenon. Again,although this has been acknowledged in the literature(see Hetherington, 2005), most researchers still conductSocietal change and trust in institutions7cross-sectional analyses without making comparisons\\nover time, even though it has been demonstrated thattrust dynamics may differ significantly depending onthe context (Boda and Medve-Bálint, 2014). Within theobvious limitations of the data that are available, thisreport focuses on the dynamics of trust indicators.\\nTrust in national institutions\\nThis section reviews the literature on trust ininstitutions. It gives an account of the factors affectingtrust at both the macro and the micro levels, includingperceptions of the characteristics of institutionaloperation. It then provides a short overview of thepossible practical consequences of trust in institutions.Following the organisation of the scholarly literature,this section then focuses on national institutions. Trustin the EU is covered in the next section, ‘Trust in EUinstitutions’ (p. 9).\\nTrust at the macro level\\nTrust is determined by a number of factors, both  macroand micro-level. At the macro level, income (GDP) isconsidered to be a strong predictor, at least in Europe,with high-income countries usually having higher publicconfidence in institutions (Delhey and Newton, 2005;Anderson and Singer, 2008; Medve-Bálint and Boda,2014). However, after conducting a multilevel analysison the data of 65 countries, Wang and Gordon (2011)found no statistically significant association betweennational income and the level of trust in institutions.A possible explanation is that, from a globalperspective, the European development model is apeculiar one in which different dimensions of socialwell-being (including trust), institutional quality andmaterial welfare are all positively associated with eachother.\\nIt is particularly interesting that, against the\\nbackground of economic crisis and growing inequality(OECD, 2015), there are surprisingly few studies onincome inequality and trust in institutions. Severalstudies have however revealed a negative associationbetween income inequality and social (interpersonal)trust (Uslaner, 2000; Wang and Gordon, 2011). Given thestrong association between interpersonal trust andinstitutional confidence, one would assume a similarpattern between income inequality and trust ininstitutions. Indeed, the multilevel study of inequalityand trust in institutions conducted by Anderson andSinger (2008), using a sample of 20 European countries,found that higher income inequality was associatedwith lower trust in institutions. However, while incomeinequality generally has a negative effect on trust,countries in central and eastern Europe seem to be anexception to this. In these countries, trust in institutionsis not associated with inequality (Medve-Bálint andBoda, 2014); instead, relatively low trust levels co-existwith relatively low income inequality. The explanationfor this might lie in the characteristics of the politicalculture and people’s attitudes: in the central andeastern European countries, people generallyoverestimate the level of income inequality and expresshigh expectations for government involvement insolving social problems (Medve-Bálint and Boda, 2014).\\nTrust in institutions is also influenced by the general\\nculture of trust of the given society. Fukuyama (1995)argued that societies can be characterised either ashigh-trust or low-trust cultures, and that this feature issomehow rooted in history. Approaches that emphasisethe role of political culture argue that ‘institutional trustis exogenous to the political sphere, originating inlong-standing and deeply seeded cultural norms and isan emergent property of interpersonal trust which isprojected onto political institutions’ (Campbell, 2004,p. 402). These approaches hold that trust in institutionsis part of a larger belief system that influences how andhow much people trust each other and impersonalorganisations. To put it simply, the level of trust ininstitutions is greater in societies where, because ofspecific historical and cultural factors, general socialtrust is greater (Kunioka and Woller, 1999). Indeed,Keele (2007) found that there is a remarkably strongassociation between interpersonal trust and trust ininstitutions at the country level – this strong associationsuggests that a common cultural background variablemay determine both. However, the greater volatility oftrust in institutions compared to interpersonalconfidence suggests that the former is influenced byfactors outside the general cultural background; forinstance, by perceptions of institutional performance(Boda and Medve-Bálint, 2014).\\nTrust at the individual level\\nTrust can be influenced by individual-level factors:generally speaking, wealthier, more educated, morereligious and more optimistic people tend to havegreater trust in institutions (Newton and Zmerli, 2011;Boda and  Medve-Bálint, 2014).\\nHowever, the results of different studies are not\\nconclusive in terms of individual-level determinants.The role of personal income has received particularattention, with contradictory results. For instance,Kaasa and Parts (2008) analysed trust in 31 Europeancountries, relying on data from the World Values Survey(WVS, 1999–2002) and found that income,operationalised as household income decile, did nothave a significant relationship with trust in institutions.However, Catterberg and Moreno (2006) found thatwell-being, defined as financial satisfaction andsatisfaction with one’s life, was positively andsignificantly associated with trust in institutions in theirsample of 26 countries. Catterberg and Moreno alsoincluded an income variable into their model, and theresults suggested that higher individual incomedecreased trust in established democracies, while itboosted trust in eastern Europe and in Latin America.Policy context and literature review8These results contradict the findings of Kaasa and Parts\\n(2008), even though both pieces of research relied onthe same WVS datasets. \\nFrom an analysis of patterns of trust in institutions in\\n10 central and eastern European countries, Mishlerand Rose (2001) found that individual-level incomehad virtually no effect on trust in institutions.However, using data from the European Social Survey,Medve-Bálint and Boda (2014) reported that themarginal effect of household income is positive inwestern European countries but negative in central andeastern Europe. The positive association between trustand income implies that the ‘winner hypothesis’ holds(that is, successful people have more trust ininstitutions). On the other hand, the lack of thisphenomenon in east central Europe suggests theplausibility of a ‘dependency hypothesis’, whereeconomically disadvantaged citizens who depend onthe state’s welfare services trust institutions more, or a‘frustration hypothesis’, where economicallyadvantaged citizens are dissatisfied with theinstitutional performance of their country.\\nAt the individual level, at least one more consideration\\nmerits attention. Research has highlighted theimportance of collective identity in promoting trust andcooperative behaviour (Kramer et al, 2001; Tyler, 2011).That is, identification with a group or a supra-individualentity (like the nation state) increases both trusting andcooperative attitudes. For instance, after studying theroots of tax compliance, Bartha and Boda (2016) foundthat, in Hungary, beyond any other sociodemographicor attitudinal variables, the strongest predictor of bothtrust in the tax authority and voluntary tax complianceis the degree of identification with the nation (measuredthrough agreement with the statement ‘I am proud tobe Hungarian’).\\nTrust as a function of institutional\\noperation \\nAn important body of literature argues that trust in\\ninstitutions is largely shaped by perceptions of thefairness and the (outcome-based) performance of thoseinstitutions (Murtin et al, 2018). This has importantpolicy implications: increasing trust and legitimacyrequires improving normative rightness as well as theperformance of state institutions.\\nOne important question concerns the relative\\nimportance of fairness and outcome-basedperformance in shaping trust and the extent to whichthis interaction is affected by contextual variables. Itcomes as no surprise that people need to believe thatinstitutions are effective (e.g. that the police and courtsare professional and able to fulfil their roles) in order totrust them (see Jackson et al, 2011; Tyler, 2011).However, many studies argue that normativeconsiderations are just as, or even more, important thaninstrumental ones in shaping trust in institutions. Thishas been demonstrated in the case of a number ofdifferent institutional settings: government (Levi et al,2009), the law (Tyler, 1990; Jackson et al, 2011), thepolice (Tyler, 2006b; Hawdon, 2008), tax authorities(Murphy, 2004) and municipalities (Tyler, 2011). Byanalysing European data, Grönlund and Setälä alsoshowed that trust in institutions at the individual leveldepends both on interpersonal trust and on certainnormative expectations posed towards thoseinstitutions: ‘the more people trust other people andthe more honest they find the civil servants of theircountry, the more they trust public institutions’(Grönlund and Setälä, 2012, p. 538).\\nAmong the normative concerns considered in the\\nliterature, the role of procedural fairness has beenparticularly emphasised. In his ground-breaking study,Tyler (1990) argued that procedural fairness is the mainroot of both trust and compliance behaviour. Murphy(2004) found that in Australia, tax evasion was linked tothe perceived unfairness of the tax authority. Thisexplains why, seemingly paradoxically, imposing strictsanctions did not have a positive effect on willingness topay tax. Instead, these measures triggered further taxevasion. Similarly, Gangl (2003) argues that people’sperceptions of the legitimacy of the US Congress aremore influenced by considerations of proceduralfairness concerning its functioning than by anydistributive effects (outcomes) of decisions. Accordingto Tyler (2011), procedural fairness may refer to normsof both decision-making (for instance, lack of bias,transparency, stakeholder inclusion, participation) andtreatment (respect, benevolence, reliability). In otherwords, people trust an institution based on theirperceptions of how it treats them and whether it makesfair decisions. Consequently, perceptions of corruption,discrimination and undemocratic functioning are likelyto decrease confidence. \\nPractical consequences of trust\\nTrust is important because it is a powerful indicator ofquality of life and social well-being (Eurofound, 2013b).However, it is also important because it is believed tofoster economic development as well as the efficiencyof governance through three basic mechanisms:stabilising social interactions; providing support fordifficult political decisions; and helping with theimplementation of policies and the effective operationof state institutions.\\nSince trust essentially involves expectations concerning\\nthe future, it stabilises social interactions as it lowerstransaction costs and increases predictability. Theexistence of stable, reliable and trustworthy stateinstitutions are an important condition of thedevelopment of the private sector (Brunetti et al, 1997;Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012).Societal change and trust in institutions9Also, trust in institutions is believed to be a measure of\\nthe support citizens give to the government, andsupport is a precious resource for the effective use ofpower (Easton, 1965). The lack of trust may signallegitimacy problems and make it difficult for thegovernment to initiate long-term (albeit much-neededor beneficial) policies. Unfortunately, there are fewpractical studies around this subject. Győrffy (2012)demonstrated that trust in institutions was a key factorin successful fiscal adjustment programmes acrossEurope, as in high-trust countries citizens believed inand accepted the necessity of austerity measures. In theUS, Hetherington (2005) showed that trust in thegovernment is the strongest predictor of passing‘liberal’ (that is, welfare) policies, irrespective of thepolitical leaning of the government. Welfare policies arepolitically risky in the US context and greater trustprovides the necessary support for policy action. Ofcourse, it is not true that all risky or painful decisionsare necessarily beneficial in the long run; therefore, thetrust of citizens can also be abused by decision-makers.However, given the dynamic nature of trust, one wouldexpect public confidence to fall in such a case. \\nFinally, it is also believed that trust in institutions makes\\ngovernance more efficient and policy implementationeasier, as people who have confidence in institutionsare more willing to comply with state authorities andthe law, pay taxes and generally take part in collectiveaction (Tyler, 2006b; Tyler, 2011; OECD, 2013). Trustreduces the transaction costs of governmentaloperations and therefore makes the functioning ofpublic administration more efficient (Van de Walle,2017). Research shows that the legitimacy of, and trustin, the legal system are the strongest predictors of thewillingness of people to obey the law and to cooperatewith authorities across countries (Jackson et al, 2014).Citizens who are not trusting, on the other hand, aremore likely to calculate the costs and benefits ofcompliance, and this might lead to freeriding practices(Tyler, 2006b). Using data from the 1998 InternationalSocial Survey Programme, Dalton (2004) found a strongpositive association between variables measuring thedegree of disagreement with misreporting income inorder to avoid tax and falsely claim government benefitson the one hand and trust in parliament and in thecourts on the other. However, both trust measurementsproved to be strongly related to upholding norms withregard to taxes and social benefits. Other studies alsofound that trust in the government and trust in the taxauthority predicts voluntary tax compliance attitudes(Murphy, 2004; Bird et al, 2008).\\nThe erosion of trust may also have political\\nconsequences. Morales (2017) argues that there is apositive association between trust in politicalinstitutions and voting behaviour, implying that erodingtrust may lead to political disengagement and cynicism.A similar pattern is observable concerning partymembership. In contrast, the association betweenconfidence in political institutions and protestbehaviour is much weaker, and sometimes thisrelationship is even marginally positive (that is, thosewho express confidence are more likely to protest),sometimes not significant (levels of political confidenceare unrelated to protest behaviour) and sometimesnegative (those who express less confidence are morelikely to protest). The nature of this relationship variesacross countries and over time. Finally, there are someindications that decreasing trust may lead to growingsupport for populist and radical parties (Morales, 2017).\\nTrust in EU institutions\\nThe extent of trust in EU institutions is of as muchinterest as trust in national ones, especially in the wakeof the result of the UK referendum supporting thecountry’s exit from the EU. It is particularly informativeto review trust in the EU in comparison with trust innational institutions. When trust in the EU iscomparatively lower, this might signal the growth orspread of anti-EU sentiment. The close relationshipbetween the two might reveal the potential of spill-overeffects from one to the other: for example, if distrust innational institutions decreases trust in EU institutions.This might reflect a tendency among citizens not to beable to distinguish clearly between one and the other.\\nThe crisis provides an interesting example of changes in\\nEuropean citizens’ perceptions of EU institutions. Rothet al (2013) analysed the effects of the crisis on trust innational and EU institutions at the beginning of thecrisis (within an EU27 country sample during the period1999 to 2012). Results showed that the overall negativetrend of declining trust was mostly accounted for by thedecrease in trust in countries in the euro zone – inparticular, in Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain.Econometric analysis revealed that the significantincrease in unemployment rates in those four countries,especially in Spain, largely contributed to thispronounced fall in trust. Papaioannou (2013) alsoconfirmed that attitudes towards European institutionshave deteriorated in crisis-hit countries, but highlightedthat this effect was less pronounced than the fall in trustin local political parties and politicians.\\nFactors affecting trust and distrust \\nIndividual factors\\nVarious studies have focused on the origins of trust inthe EU, testing theories about the role of identificationwith Europe, national political culture, education levelsand media consumption (Gabel and Whitten, 1997;Gabel, 1998; Hooghe, 2007; Arnold et al, 2012). Identityand emotional attachment to Europe indeed seem toplay a role for instance, Manzi et al (2016) argue thatthere is an attachment to the EU, even in countries withincreasing unemployment and poor living standards.Policy context and literature review10People tend to care about the EU’s democratic\\nprocedures and institutions; however, their perceivedimportance has changed over time due to increasedpublic awareness of the consequences of the EUintegration process (Torcal et al, 2012). The growth inhigher education in itself might lead to more awarenessof the shortcomings of EU institutions and make citizensmore hesitant, or even unwilling, to trust them (Arnoldet al, 2012). As citizens learn more, they may alsobecome more critical and set higher standards for theirrepresentatives. This suggests that as more powers aretransferred to the EU level, people may become morecritical and demanding of EU institutions (Hobolt, 2012).In addition, those with high levels of political knowledgerely more heavily on evaluations of EU institutions whenassessing democracy in the EU (Karp et al, 2003).\\nA recent study (Conti and Memoli, 2017) highlighted the\\nrole of the media in trust towards the EU. Those who aremost exposed to traditional media are more favourablydisposed towards the EU process and are more likely totrust EU institutions.\\nOn the other hand, the more divided the national\\nleaders are, the more people are prone to opposeEuropean integration, and this effect is particularlypronounced among people who see themselves asexclusively national citizens (Hooghe and Marks, 2005).\\nMacro-level conditions\\nTrust in the European Commission and the EuropeanParliament seems to be strongly associated with thesituation in the real economy (unemployment andgrowth of GDP per capita), but only in times of crisis(Roth et al, 2011). Similarly, Gomez (2015) showed thatsupport for the EU is indeed correlated withmacroeconomic conditions after the crisis, which isunsurprising given the unpopularity of EU-backedausterity measures in many crisis-hit countries.\\nIncome inequality negatively affects trust in the\\nEuropean Commission and the European Parliament innormal times, while in times of crisis this relationship isstrengthened and extended to the European CentralBank (ECB). In addition, inflation and unemploymentseem to have considerably affected trust in allEuropean institutions in a negative way after the crisis(Bonasia et al, 2016). \\nInstitutional performance: European and national\\nHarteveld et al (2013), as well as Armingeon and Ceka(2014), argue that attitudes towards the EU are primarilyderived from public opinion about national-levelpolitics and policy: that is, the institutional performanceof the EU has little, if any, effect on public confidence.However, others argue that public trust in the EU isresponsive to the performance of European institutions,and the existence of trust (or mistrust) in ‘distant’institutions suggests that people are not indifferent towhat happens in supranational institutions (Hudson,2006).\\nDifferent explanations for the decline of trust in the EU\\nare provided by studies on the consequences of theeconomic crisis (see for instance, Kumlin, 2009;Armingeon and Ceka, 2014). The loss of trust in the EUafter 2008 was explained both by poor economicperformance and by the quality of governance(via subjective assessments of how governments dealtwith corruption) according to Mungiu-Pippidi et al(2015). Numerous studies further argue that support forEuropean integration derives from the ability ofEU institutions to deliver economic benefits, either forindividual households or for the nation as a whole(Gabel, 1998; Christin, 2005; Gomez, 2015). \\nPeople from countries with relatively extensive welfare\\nstates are more likely to trust the EU institutions,possibly because of an already developed confidencethat institutional bodies will provide them withsatisfactory services (Arnold et al, 2012). Furthermore,according to Freitag and Bühlmann (2009), people livingin countries where authorities are seen as incorruptible,where the institutions of the welfare state reduceincome disparities, and where political interests arerepresented in a manner proportional to their weightare more likely to have higher levels of trust.\\nOn the other hand, dissatisfaction with national public\\nservices seems to have direct negative effects on trust inthe EU in most of the EU15 countries. The effect isstronger in larger welfare states where the limitationson welfare policies are perceived as stemming from theEU and where the most euro-sceptic parties are themost likely to support the welfare state (Kumlin, 2009).\\nAcross Europe, the public evaluates institutions not only\\nin terms of efficiency, but also in terms of integrity(Eurofound, 2012). Corruption erodes trust in thenational political system, lowers the perceived costs ofceding sovereignty to supranational bodies, andincreases citizens’ willingness to turn to the EU foralternatives (Sánchez-Cuenca, 2000; Arnold et al, 2012).Moreover, people living in Member States with a higherlevel of national corruption seem to have more trust ininternational institutions, such as the EU. However, thisrelationship appears to have dissipated after 2008(Obydenkova and Arpino, 2017). Despite this narrowinggap, trust in national institutions remains lower thantrust in the EU (EPRS, 2016). This is confirmed in thecase of Romania where euro-enthusiasm has national,rather than European, roots (Radu, 2016). By contrast,living in a country with highly trusted andwell-performing institutions appears to reduce trust inthe European Parliament (Muñoz et al, 2011). In otherwords, national proxies seem to play a leading role inshaping EU-related opinions and attitudes.Societal change and trust in institutions11In light of the empirical findings, several authors have\\nput forward policy proposals to suggest how toimprove public confidence in the EU. According toMungiu-Pippidi et al (2015), since the current crisis intrust was, to a certain extent, brought about by thecontrast between the harsh austerity measures laidupon citizens and the self-serving behaviour andflouting of rules indulged in by politicians, a change inthe behaviour of EU politicians would help restore trust.Hobolt (2012) argues that as people attribute morepower to the EU level and become more knowledgeableabout how it operates, they become more demanding ofthe quality of democratic institutions beyond the nationstate. Introducing a sense of public ownership istherefore essential, irrespective of the level and locationof decision-making.Papaioannou (2016) argues the need for institutionalreform at the EU level and institutional convergencetowards best practices. He proposes the establishmentof a European‐ level body to monitor institutional\\nperformance and state capacity across the EU and theeuro zone. To tackle the rise of populism and restoreconfidence in the EU, Algan et al (2017) further proposethe implementation of countercyclical macroeconomicpolicies to prevent high levels of unemployment and topreserve the trust of people facing economic insecurityby providing better social security nets for theunemployed. \\nSome argue that improvements in the economic\\nsituation alone would not necessarily restore supportfor the European project. The EU needs to deliver globalpublic goods and provide security, while respecting thenational identities of EU citizens (Dustmann et al, 2017).\\nPolicy context and literature review13Patterns of trust dynamics\\nLong-term trends in trust \\nThe assessment of longer-term trends of trust in\\ninstitutions during the 21st century is based on datafrom the Eurobarometer study. This study usesdichotomous questions to measure trust (where 1means ‘tend to trust’ and 0 means ‘tend not to trust’),therefore trust in a given country at a given time can becharacterised by the percentage of respondents whotend to trust the specific institution. Unfortunately, notall items are present in every wave of the study, whichmakes it difficult to construct a consistent series ofcomposite indicators of different types of trust. Thus,instead of building composite indicators, the evolutionof trust is described here in terms of trust in selectednational institutions (government, police, the press) andthe EU. \\nAs Figures 1 and 2 show, there are important differences\\nin trends of trust in institutions between the regions ofEurope, but variation can also be found betweencountries in the same region. In general, the northernEuropean Member States are characterised by relativelyhigh levels of trust in their national governments andtrust in the EU. While trust in national governmentsdeclined during the crisis years in Denmark andincreased after 2014, in the case of Finland and Swedenonly smaller fluctuations occurred during the sameperiod. In the case of Sweden and Denmark there is alsoa sub-period where trust in the EU declined, but bothcountries had greater trust in the EU in 2017 than in2001.\\nThere are also differences in the patterns of change in\\nnational trust in institutions among countries in westernEurope. Trust in the national governments and the EUseems to be slightly declining in Austria, Belgium andFrance, although in the case of France there was somerecovery of trust in government at the end of the period.The most significant decline in trust in government andthe EU can be seen in Ireland, which was probably thecountry hit most hard by the crisis in this region.Although there was a notable recovery at the end of theperiod, trust levels did not return to their pre-crisislevels. In the cases of Germany, Luxembourg, theNetherlands and the UK, trust in the government and inthe EU fluctuates during this period, but levels weresimilar at the beginning and the end of the period.\\nMost of the countries in Figure 2 had greater trust in the\\nEU than the national government (with the exception ofCyprus) throughout the period. In southern Europeancountries such as Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain, whichwere severely hit by the economic crisis, a clear declinein trust in the national government and the EU can bedetected. In Portugal, there was some recovery of trustlevels by the end of the period, although trust in the EUwas still lower in 2017 than at the beginning of theperiod. \\nAmong the eastern European countries, only Slovenia\\nshowed a decline in both trust in the EU and in thegovernment during the period. In the Visegrad countries(the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia), aswell as Bulgaria and Romania, trust in the EU declinedover the period, while trust in the national governmentfluctuated or slightly increased, as is the case of Poland.As a result, trust in the EU and trust in the nationalgovernment have converged. In the Baltic countries,trust in both the EU and the government broadlystagnated, while in Croatia trust in the EU increased.\\nOverall, these results suggest that there is no uniform\\ntrend of declining trust in national institutions in EUcountries. Many countries saw declining trust in politicalinstitutions (national government or the EU) during theyears of the economic crisis. However, even duringthese years there were countries where political trustdid not decline, for instance, Poland. On the other hand,before and after the crisis years political trust evenincreased in several countries.\\nTrust in non-political state institutions (such as the\\npolice) did not closely follow the trends of political trustand did not fall during the crisis years. Trust in the pressalso showed less volatility over the same period thantrust in national governments. Comparing the first andlast observation of the period under analysis, trust innational government was lower in 2017 than in 2001 inroughly half of EU28 countries (15 out of 28). The sameis true for 13 countries in the case of the press, but onlyin five countries for trust in police. On the other hand,trust in the EU declined in a majority of countries (20 outof 28), and only a minority of eight countries saw eitherno further decline or an increase of trust in the EU overthe period. \\nThese longer-term trends in trust in institutions also\\nshed light on the volatility of trust. The business cycleand political changes affect changes, especially in trustin political institutions. For instance, the sudden rise oftrust in the government in Portugal in recent years, orthe rise in trust in institutions in Hungary around 2010was linked to the election of a new government. Theunpredictability and variation in the case of specificinstitutions is one of the arguments in favour of\\n2Key findings on trust in\\ninstitutions   14monitoring a range of institutions, as has been\\nundertaken by the European Quality of Life Survey(EQLS).\\nMapping changes in trust in national\\ninstitutions\\nThis section takes a different perspective on changes in\\ntrust in institutions using the EQLS. Here, trust ininstitutions is measured on a 10-point scale(where 1 means ‘do not trust at all’ and 10 means‘trust completely’), which allows the finer measurementof trust attitudes. This is important as this finermeasurement scale makes the construction ofcomposite indicators easier and allows for theinvestigation of tendencies to polarisation.Despite differences in the measurement scales for trustvariables and other methodological details of theEurobarometer and the EQLS, survey results regardingthe direction of changes in trust in institutions aresimilar, especially in the case of the crisis period(see in the separate technical report publishedalongside this report – Societal change and trust ininstitutions: Analysis of results). In the case of trust innational government, both surveys show declining trustbetween 2007 and 2011 in most countries. For theperiod between 2011 and 2016, the number of countrieswith increasing and declining trust is roughly equalbased on the Eurobarometer, while the EQLS suggeststhat trust in institutions has increased in a majority ofcountries.Societal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 1: Long-term trends for trust in national government and in EU institutions – northern and western\\nMember States (%)\\nNote: Trust in institutions is measured with a dichotomous item where 1 = ‘tend to trust’ and 0 = ‘tend not to trust’. \\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Eurobarometer 2001–2017 01020304050607080Denmark\\n01020304050607080Finland\\n01020304050607080Sweden\\n01020304050607080Austria\\n01020304050607080Belgium\\n01020304050607080Germany\\n01020304050607080France\\n01020304050607080Ireland\\n01020304050607080Luxembourg\\n01020304050607080Netherlands\\n01020304050607080United Kingdom\\nTrust in the EU Trust in national government15Key findings on trust in institutions\\nFigure 2: Long-term trends for trust in national government and in EU institutions – eastern, central and\\nsouthern Member States (%)\\n01020304050607080Estonia\\n01020304050607080Latvia\\n01020304050607080Lithuania\\n01020304050607080Poland\\n01020304050607080Czech Republic\\n01020304050607080Slovakia\\n01020304050607080Hungary\\n01020304050607080Slovenia\\n01020304050607080Croatia\\n01020304050607080Portugal\\n01020304050607080Spain\\n01020304050607080Italy\\n01020304050607080Malta\\n01020304050607080Cyprus\\n01020304050607080Greece\\n01020304050607080Bulgaria\\n01020304050607080Romania\\nNote: Trust in institutions is measured with a dichotomous item, where 1 = ‘tend to trust’ and 0 = ‘tend not to trust’. \\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Eurobarometer 2001–2017 Trust in the EU Trust in national government16One measure of overall trust in institutions is based on\\nthe five items that are present in the second, third andfourth waves of the EQLS (hereafter termed EQLS 2007,EQLS 2011 and EQLS 2016): namely, trust in the nationalparliament, trust in the national government, trust inthe legal system, trust in the police and trust in the news(media). Respondents’ overall trust in nationalinstitutions is characterised by averaging responses tothese questions. Analysis of the reliability of thismeasure of overall trust in institutions shows that thisscale is internally consistent in every Member State inthe EQLS 2007, EQLS 2011 and EQLS 2016.\\n1Figure 3\\nshows the value of this indicator of trust in nationalinstitutions in different countries in the years 2007, 2011and 2016.Societal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 3: Trust in national institutions, 2007, 2011 and 2016, by country (%)\\n1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0CroatiaBulgariaGreeceSloveniaSlovakiaCyprusSpainItalyPolandLatviaRomaniaFranceCzech RepublicPortugalLithuaniaIrelandUKHungaryBelgiumMaltaEstoniaGermanyAustriaNetherlandsSwedenLuxembourgDenmarkFinland\\n2007 2011 2016\\nNotes: Countries are sorted according to data in 2016.

The value of this\\nstatistic is close to or higher than 0.80 in all countries in all waves of the survey. The only exception is Denmark in 2011, but the Cronbach α is higher than0.70 in this case as well. A reliability coefficient of 0.70 or higher is considered acceptable in most social science research situations.17Overall trust in institutions was lowest in 2007 in\\nBulgaria, Croatia and Latvia, where the average trustrating was below 4. Values between 4 and 4.5 were alsofound in other central and eastern European countriesas well as in Italy. The highest levels of trust ininstitutions were in the northern European countriesDenmark and Finland, where the overall score was closeto 7. Values over 6 were also found in Austria, theNetherlands and Sweden. The Member States withmid-level trust in institutions included westernEuropean countries and the southern Europeancountries, together with Estonia. Between 2007 and2011, trust in institutions declined in most EU MemberStates. Countries heavily affected by the economicdownturn – such as Greece and Spain – showed thebiggest decline in trust in institutions, but Romania,Slovakia and Cyprus also saw a significant decline intrust. Although trust in institutions declined at all levels,countries with relatively low levels of trust at thebeginning saw the greatest fall in trust. In several othercountries trust either increased or did not change –Germany, Luxembourg, the UK, Bulgaria, Croatia, andSweden.The most recent data suggest that the decline in trust ininstitutions during the crisis years was a temporaryphenomenon, as between 2011 and 2016 trust ininstitutions increased in most EU countries. The biggestincreases were seen in Lithuania, Hungary andRomania, where the trust score increased by more thanone point. Trust in institutions also grew substantially inPortugal, Latvia and Greece. Again, the greatest changeswere seen among countries with relatively low levels oftrust in institutions in 2011, which means that thesecountries were able to close the gap with countriescharacterised by higher trust levels. Trust levelsremained unchanged in Denmark, France and Spain. \\nAs shown by Figure 4, during the entire period from 2007\\nto 2016, seven countries recorded a statisticallysignificant decline in trust in institutions. The mostsignificant decline in trust was recorded in Spain, withconfidence decreasing considerably during the crisisyears and no improvement reported in the subsequentperiod. Trust in institutions also saw a major decline inGreece over the entire period, despite the significantimprovement between 2011 and 2016.

Trustin some institutions may be more politicised andexpress an attitude of general legitimacy, while in othercases, trust in institutions may stem from personalexperience and be more outcome-oriented.

Even countries with high levels of political trustsuch as Denmark and Finland saw declining trust in thisperiod. On the other hand, some countries – Sweden,Luxembourg, Germany, the UK, Hungary, Poland, andBulgaria saw no decline or only a minimal decline intrust in political institutions during the crisis years.During the period 2011–2016, trust in politicalinstitutions increased, although the increase was moremoderate than the decline in the previous period.\\nAs Figure 6 shows, trust in the legal system and the\\npolice is somewhat greater in EU countries than trust inpolitical institutions, and changes in trust were moremoderate for these institutions. During the crisis years(2007–2011), the fall in trust in non-political stateinstitutions was smaller than the fall in trust in politicalinstitutions, but during the second sub-period(2011–2016) the rise in trust was also more moderate.Figure 7 indicates that  trust in the media has also beenless volatile than trust in political institutions.\\nChanges in trust – EU institutions\\nTrust in EU institutions, measured for the EU as a whole,had a declining trend from 2007 to 2011, somestabilisation between 2011 and 2015 and a slightSocietal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 7: Trust in the media, 2007, 2011 and 2016 \\n1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0GreeceSloveniaCroatiaUKFranceCyprusHungarySpainSlovakiaPolandCzech RepublicBulgariaIrelandAustriaItalyMaltaDenmarkBelgiumPortugalLatviaGermanyLithuaniaEstoniaRomaniaLuxembourgSwedenNetherlandsFinland\\n2007 2011 2016\\nNotes: Countries are sorted according to data in 2016.

In particular,\\ntrust in the EU started declining after the onset of theeconomic crisis and reached its lowest level in 2012when less than a third of EU citizens surveyed reportedthat they had trust in the EU. After a period when itremained stable, it started increasing again. At thebeginning of 2017, nearly 42% of EU citizens reportedhaving confidence in the EU. Part of this late recoverymay be related to the difference in the sequence ofquestions in the last survey compared with the previousStandard Eurobarometer. This may have putrespondents in a more positive frame of mind whenanswering (European Commission, 2017a). Moreover,the proportion of non-responses was higher in 2004 and2007 than in 2011 and 2016 in the EU as a whole, whichmay reflect greater indecision among EU citizens beforethe crisis started (for details on the treatment of ‘don’tknow’ answers, see separate technical report\\n3).\\nThis suggests that EU citizens adopted a more definitepoint of view on the EU as a result of the economiccrisis, particularly in a number of countries where theproportion of non-responses declined sharply,for instance, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Ireland,Spain, Italy, Austria and the UK. On the other hand,indecision seemed to increase (that is, the proportionof non-responses went up) between 2007 and 2016 in afew countries, for instance, Denmark, Estonia and Malta.The level of trust is not the same for all EU institutions,though it tends to change over time in a similar way totrust in the EU overall. Citizens tend to have more trustin the European Parliament (even if trust in thisinstitution has declined since 2004) than, for instance, inthe European Commission or in the ECB.\\n4Between 2004\\nand 2017, the proportion of EU citizens who had trust inthe European Parliament fell by 12 percentage points,from just over 56% to slightly under 44%, while trust inthe European Commission fell from 50% to 41% overthe same period of time. For both institutions, thesharpest reduction was in crisis-hit countries; this willbe elaborated in a later section.\\nTrust in the ECB declined by even more over this period,\\nfrom 53% of people expressing trust at the beginning of2007 to 37% at the beginning of 2017 with a low of 31%in mid-2014. This reduction is noted in the literature.Trust in the ECB was scarcely affected by business cyclevariables such as growth and inflation before 2008, butwith the recession, a closer correlation betweenvariations in country economic indicators (such as GDPgrowth, inflation and unemployment rate) and trust inthe ECB developed (Gros and Roth, 2010). However, therecovery which began in mid-2009 was not able torestore trust in the ECB to previous levels. This findingseems to imply that EU citizens put a significant share ofthe blame for the economic downturn on the ECBKey findings on trust in institutions\\n3 More detailed results of analysis are presented in a technical report that accompanies this report and is available in the form of a working paper at\\neurofound.link/ef18036.\\n4 EU citizens also tend to have more trust in the European Court of Justice than other EU institutions.Figure 8: Trust in EU institutions, EU28, 2004–2017 (%)  \\n05101520253035404550556065\\nEU European Parliament European Commission European Central Bank\\nNote: Percentages are of the population aged 15 and over.

Some sources argue that\\nthe deterioration in the economy, the crisis and theproblems in the banking sector resulted not only in alessening of confidence in the ECB, but also in a generalfall in trust in EU institutions (Ehrmann et al, 2013).\\nThe sharpest reductions in trust in the EU between 2004\\nand 2016 occurred in countries most severely affectedby the economic downturn: Greece (-43 percentagepoints), Cyprus (-31 percentage points) and Spain(-26.5 percentage points) (Figure 9). In Ireland, trust inthe EU declined dramatically when the country was hitby the crisis (-34 percentage points between 2004 and2011; with just one person in four having confidence inthe EU in 2011), but confidence was restored as thecountry recovered, with almost half (49%) of thepopulation expressing trust in the EU in 2016. \\nIn these countries, trust in the EU declined in parallel to\\nthe decline in trust in national institutions. In Spain forinstance, trust in political parties dropped abruptlyfollowing corruption scandals and poor management ofthe crisis: in 2017, only 7% of people reported havingconfidence in political parties compared with 40% in2008. In Greece, the figure was only 4% in 2017compared to 17% in 2008. Moreover, the governmentcrises in France and Italy might have resulted in a loss ofconfidence in national government policy and in thecapacity of governments to cope with the economiccrisis and to support the European project (trust in theEU dropped by 24 percentage points in France and 26percentage points in Italy between 2004 and 2016).\\nIn contrast, in two countries (Finland and Sweden) trust\\nin the EU increased over the period despite GDP in realterms being 3% lower in 2016 than in 2008 when thecrisis hit, but in these countries it seems that theeconomic decline was perceived as being more a resultof domestic factors than of external ones. In Lithuaniaand Romania, the level of trust remained high despite aslight decrease. Both of these countries have alwayshad a higher level of trust in the EU than other countriesin the region, which suggests that their populations aremore optimistic about the EU in general or value thepositive changes that occurred after EU accession more.On the other hand, in the case of Romania, it may bethat perceived issues in the national government bysome part of the population put the EU in a favourablelight.

This has importantpolicy implications because it gives an insight intowhether trust in the EU can be achieved independentlyof changes in trust in national institutions.Key findings on trust in institutions\\nFigure 10: Trust in EU institutions, 2004–2016 (%)\\n0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0GreeceFranceCyprusCzech RepublicItalyUKSpainAustriaGermanySloveniaHungarySlovakiaNetherlandsSwedenCroatiaEstoniaLatviaPolandDenmarkBelgiumPortugalBulgariaIrelandFinlandLuxembourgMaltaRomaniaLithuaniaEU28\\n2016 2011 2007 2004\\nNote: Countries are sorted according to data in 2016.\\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Eurobarometer.  24Changes in trust in EU institutions tend to be closely\\nrelated to changes in trust in national institutions.According to the literature, trust at national andEU levels might move in parallel (‘congruence’),because people might extrapolate their experience ofnational institutions to the supranational level (seeMuñoz et al, 2011). An alternative hypothesis is thattrust in national institutions and the EU might beinversely related (a ‘compensation’ or ‘substitution’effect). People living in countries with well-performinginstitutions might be less willing to support transferringsovereignty to a supranational institution, while thoseliving in countries with low-performing institutions mayhave reason to place greater trust in EU institutions.\\nTable 1 shows the correlation (that is, the linear\\nrelationship) at EU level between the proportion ofpeople who trust in national institutions and theproportion of those who trust in EU institutions over theperiod 2004–2017. Trust in the EU has a strong andsignificant positive correlation with trust in nationalgovernments and national parliaments. When the shareof people with confidence in national governments orparliaments increases, the share of those who trust inthe EU also increases, and conversely, when trust innational governments or parliaments decreases, trust inthe EU also decreases. In addition, there is a strongpositive relationship between trust in nationalparliaments and trust in the European Parliament, theEuropean Commission, the ECB and the European Courtof Justice.\\n5Accordingly, a decline in trust in national\\nparliaments will tend to be associated with a parallelreduction in respect of EU institutions. Attitudestowards national political institutions seem to play animportant role in shaping attitudes towards EUinstitutions, as underlined in the literature (Muñoz et al,2011; Radu, 2016; Obydenkova and Arpino, 2017).Analysis at country level for the period 2004–2017 (seetechnical report) confirms the results presented above.When statistically significant,\\n6the relationship between\\nthe proportion of people trusting national institutionsand the proportion of people trusting EU institutions ispositive in the majority of cases. This implies that anincrease in the proportion of people who trust innational institutions is linked to an increase in the shareof people with confidence in EU institutions, andconversely, a decrease in trust in national institutions islinked to a decrease in trust in EU institutions. \\nIt is then important to determine whether the changes\\nconcerned are similar in scale or not. For the EU as awhole, while the proportion of those who hadconfidence in national government declined by2.5 percentage points between 2004 and 2016, theproportion that had confidence in the EU fell by15.5 percentage points, which may point to ablame-shifting effect to a certain extent. This effect isalso evident in many countries where the correlation issignificant, for instance, France and Italy, where trust inthe national government declined by around13 percentage points in both cases and trust in the EUfell by around 25 percentage points. In Greece, on theother hand, the reduction over the same period in theproportion of people with confidence in the nationalgovernment and the proportion with confidence in theEU was much the same, at just over  40 percentagepoints each.\\nAlthough trust in national institutions and trust in\\nEU institutions tend to be positively correlated, in somecountries, for instance, the Czech Republic, FinlandHungary, or Estonia, the correlation tends to be low andstatistically insignificant. In a small number ofcountries, a negative correlation between trust innational institutions and EU institutions has beenfound. One example is Poland, where a significantSocietal change and trust in institutions\\nTable 1: Relationship between trust in EU institutions and trust in national institutions, 2004–2017\\nTrust in the EUTrust in\\nEuropean\\nParliamentTrust in\\nEuropean\\nCommissionTrust in\\nEuropean\\nCentral BankTrust in\\nCouncil of the\\nMinisters of\\nthe EUTrust in Court\\nof Justice of\\nthe EU\\nTrust in national government 0.805*** 0.659*** 0.675*** 0.632*** 0.828*** 0.620\\nTrust in national parliament 0.891*** 0.798*** 0.800*** 0.778*** 0.854*** 0.706*\\nTrust in political parties 0.577** 0.501* 0.518** 0.582** 0.537* 0.216\\nNote: *** signifies that the correlation coefficient is significant at the 0.1% level, ** significant at the 1% level and * significant at the 5% level.\\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Eurobarometer.\\n5 However, the findings for the correlation coefficients between the proportion of people trusting the Court of Justice of the EU and the proportion of\\npeople trusting the selected national institutions have limited reliability because of the relatively small number of observations (i.e. Eurobarometerwaves) available for the analysis.\\n6 The relationship is statistically significant for all Member States, with the exception of Germany, Hungary and Finland.25negative correlation exists between trust in political\\nparties and trust in the EU.7In addition, over the\\n2004–2017 period, when the proportion of peopletrusting national institutions declined, the proportiontrusting the ECB increased in Germany, which mightalso be interpreted as a substitution effect.\\nOne possible mechanism through which an inverse\\ncorrelation between trust in national institutions andtrust in the EU could arise is when people perceiveincreasing corruption in national institutions and thisleads them to trust the EU more. The data shows,however, that there is no simple relationship betweenthe proportion of people trusting the EU and theperception of corruption at national level. The change inthe proportion of people having confidence in the EUover the 2007–2016 period does not seem to be relatedto changes in the perception of corruption at nationallevel (see the analysis in the technical report). Key findings on trust in institutions\\n7 This means that over the period 2004–2017, while the share of people with confidence in political parties diminished, the share of those with confidence\\nin the EU increased.

In some countries, such asFrance and Italy, trust in the EU declined much morethan trust in national institutions, suggesting ablame-shifting effect. A negative relationship betweentrust only seems to apply in a few countries(for instance, Poland) or in the case of some institutions(for instance, trust in Germany in the ECB). \\nInequalities in trust levels\\nDistribution of trust in institutions accross\\nthe EU\\nBehind the averages of trust in institutions, there is of\\ncourse a more complex distribution of trust in thesocieties studied. One possibility to establish thedispersion of trust is to describe how the proportion ofthose with low trust evolved during the period. In thefollowing analysis, those with low trust have beendefined as people who have a trust level lower than 60%of the median trust level in the country in a given year.Using this relative definition of low trust is useful infocusing on the dispersion of trust responses ratherthan changes in average levels of trust. Figure 11 showsthe changes in the proportion of those with low trust inMember States.\\nIn 2007, the proportion of those with low trust was\\nlowest in the northern European countries, where fewerthan 9% of the respondents had low levels of trustrelative to the median trust level. The highest levels oflow trust were found in Bulgaria and Croatia, wheremore than 25% of the respondents had low levels oftrust. In many countries the proportion of those withlow trust increased by 2011 (some 14 countries), whilethose experiencing a decline were less numerous(five countries). Between 2011 and 2016, 10 countriesrecorded a declining percentage of those with low trust,while in other countries such as Slovenia, Slovakia,France, Croatia, Denmark, Germany and Estonia theproportion of those with low trust was higher in 2016than in 2011. Overall, during the entire period,12 countries recorded an increasing occurrence of lowtrust, while this percentage declined in 6 countries.Even if the percentage with low trust increased over theperiod in the northern European countries, theseremain the countries with the lowest occurrence of lowtrust. In 2016, Slovakia had the highest percentage ofrespondents with low trust.\\nThe dispersion of trust can also be described by using\\naggregate dispersion or inequality indices such as thestandard deviation or the Gini index. Although theoriginal trust variables are measured on an ordinalscale, the composite variables of trust in this analysisare not ordinal as they were calculated by averagingseveral items related to trust in institutions. Thesevariables are based on the assumption that thenumbers used for coding trust levels are cardinalnumbers. On the other hand, they are still bounded,with 1 being the lowest possible value and 10 being thehighest possible value. The literature indicates that thisposes a problem for inequality measurement: thus, anormalised version of the Gini index based onWagstaff’s approach (as per O’Donnell et al, 2016), wasemployed for this report. This index is suitable for usewith bounded variables. These normalised Gini indicescan take values of between 0 and 1, with higher valuesindicating a greater inequality of trust (where 0 meansan equal distribution of trust and 1 corresponds to asituation of maximal inequality). \\nAs Figure 12 (and Table A1 of the Annex) shows,\\nbetween 2007 and 2011 the inequality of overall trust ininstitutions increased the most in Spain and Cyprus(+7 points, referring to a range of Gini coefficientexpressed as 0–100). In Poland, Romania and theCzech Republic inequality was also greater in 2011 thanin 2007 by close to 5 points. Overall, 14 countriesrecorded increasing inequality between 2007 and 2016.In the same period,  a few countries recorded fallinginequality in trust in institutions. Inequality declined themost in Malta,  Luxembourg and Ireland (-4 points), butalso in Bulgaria and Lithuania. Between 2011 and 2016,when average trust in institutions increased in mostcountries, inequality declined in 13 countries. In theCzech Republic inequality declined by 11 points, and inCroatia and Greece by 6 points. During this period, theinequality of trust in institutions increased in sixcountries, most significantly in Slovakia (+7 points) andFrance (+4 points).\\nPolarisation of trust across social groups\\nThis section describes the differences in dynamics oftrust in national institutions between different societalgroups. Previous research suggests that differences intrust levels might be larger between groups thanbetween countries (Zmerli and Hooghe, 2011). However,the question investigated here is not which groups havehigher or lower levels of trust in institutions, but whichgroups exhibited the largest change in trust ininstitutions in the period of the economic crisis and theyears that followed the recession. First, changes in trustin institutions will be analysed according to basicsocioeconomic variables, such as gender, age,education, employment status and income. In addition,it is also assumed that people with declining trust arenot necessarily those whose trust level (and socialstatus) is generally low, but those who perceive threatsto their social status. The analysis will also give specificattention to the situation of the middle class, assumingthat some economic and political problems havecreated growing anxieties among middle-class people,while, on the other hand, it is generally assumed that astrong middle class is a condition of stable democracy.Societal change and trust in institutions27As perceptions about the quality of public services have\\nbeen demonstrated to affect trust in institutions, theanalysis also investigates whether changes in trust ininstitutions are similarly correlated with this factor.Making use of the concept of social cohesion (Acket etal, 2011) it is also assessed if people who perceivegrowing social tensions and feel isolated experience agreater loss of confidence in institutions.\\n8The followingsection discusses the most important results of thisanalysis, while additional figures can be found in thetechnical report.\\nThe two periods, 2007–2011 and 2011–2016, are\\nreviewed separately, as drivers of change in trust ininstitutions might be different during the crisis periodand during the period of economic recovery thatfollowed. Key findings on trust in institutions\\n8 For every individual-level variable of interest, tests were carried out to explore whether the change in trust in institutions in a given country was\\nstatistically different for the two extreme categories of that variable. For example, in the case of education, tests were conducted to see if the change intrust in institutions between 2007 and 2011 was different between those with a low level of education and those with a high level of education. To testwhether the difference between subgroups is statistically significant, separate linear regression models were run, with the grouping variable interactedwith the time dummy. The coefficient of the interaction term shows the difference between the changes of trust in institutions in the categories of thegrouping variable.

Countries are sorted according to data in 2016.\\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on EQLS.  282007–2011: Income and educational differences \\nFirst, the results are summarised for the overall trust\\nvariable in the period of the economic crisis, between2007 and 2011. Differences between genders in terms ofchange in level of trust were only statistically significantin three countries: in Poland and Slovenia, trust ininstitutions declined more among men and less amongwomen, while in Austria trust declined more stronglyamong women. Statistically significant differencesbetween age groups were found in six countries.Although the economic crisis hit the young hard whilethe elderly were less affected, there were only threecountries (Italy, Finland and Sweden) where trust ininstitutions declined more among the young(aged 18–34) and declined less for the oldest age group(65+), while in other countries (Estonia, France, Cyprus)the pattern was reversed.\\nWith regard to labour market status and position in\\nsocial stratification, trust generally declined mostamong those in low-status positions (for instance,low education or low income). In a number of countries(France, Denmark, Estonia and the Czech Republic)statistically significant differences in terms of trustbetween the less well educated (those with lowersecondary education or below) and those with tertiaryeducation were found; in most cases, there was agreater decline in trust in institutions among the lesswell educated. The only exception was Austria, wheretrust in institutions declined more for those with tertiaryeducation. \\nIn the case of income, respondents were grouped in four\\nequal sized groups: those with low incomes (defined asbeing in the lowest quartile of the income distribution),the lower-middle quartile, the upper-middle and theupper quartile of the distribution. Here, the focus is ondifferences between the low income and the highincome quartile, while differences between themiddle-income groups will be analysed in a separatesection. Results show a more significant drop in trust ininstitutions among those with low incomes in fivecountries (Estonia, Spain, Slovakia, Latvia, Cyprus),while only one country (Austria) shows an invertedpattern where trust declined more among those with ahigh income. In other countries such as Portugal andRomania, the largest decline in trust in institutions isobserved among the middle class. In Greece, Cyprus,Slovenia and Slovakia the middle class show similarresults to those with low income, with a moresignificant decline of trust in the middle class than inthose with high income. Likewise, in Austria, the middleclass is more similar to those with low income, althoughin this case both show a more moderate decline in trustcompared to those with high income.To sum up the results for the overall trust variable, inthe first sub-period (2007–2011) the most importantgrouping variables proved to be education and incomestatus. The picture is similar when the trust in eachdifferent type of institution is analysed separately.In the case of trust in political institutions, educationappears to be the variable where the highest number ofcountries with statistically significant differences arefound. In the case of trust in non-political stateinstitutions and in the media, the most importantgrouping variables are education and income. \\n2011–2016: Perceived social exclusion and\\ndifferences in quality of public services \\nDuring the second, post-crisis sub-period (2011–2016),\\nthe most important grouping variable is perceivedquality of public services and perceived social exclusion.Although significant differences can be found betweeneducational and income groups, as well as betweengroups based on social tensions in 5–6 countries,perception of service quality and social exclusion isimportant in twice as many cases (in 11 countries).\\nPerception of quality of public services was earlier\\nidentified as an important predictor of trust ininstitutions as it represents a measure of the outcomeof the functioning of institutions. To investigate theimpact of this factor, three categories of respondentswere created, based on the EQLS items related toperceptions of service quality. The EQLS asksrespondents about their evaluation of the quality ofhealthcare, education, public transport, childcare andstate pension services in the EQLS 2007, EQLS 2011 andthe EQLS 2016, with responses coded on a 10-itemscale. Respondents were categorised based on theiraverage perception of service quality regarding theseitems: those perceiving low service quality are definedas people who scored lower than the 33rd percentile inEQLS 2007, while those perceiving high service qualityare those who had a higher score than the 66thpercentile in the EQLS 2007. Between 2011 and 2016,differences in the dynamics of trust in institutionsbetween groups based on perceptions of quality ofpublic services were found in almost half of all countries(see Figure 13). Countries with a significant differencewere Sweden, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Finland, Poland,Estonia, Austria, Latvia, Slovakia, Malta, Hungary andItaly. In every country where a significant difference wasfound, the increase in trust was significantly greateramong those who perceived high public service qualitythan among those who perceived low service quality.Societal change and trust in institutions29Feeling oneself to be socially excluded is likely to be\\nassociated with diminished trust in institutions. Theperceived social exclusion index refers to the overallaverage score from responses to four statements. Theseare: ‘I feel left out of society’, ‘Life has become socomplicated today that I almost can’t find my way’,‘I don’t feel that the value of what I do is recognised byothers’ and ‘Some people look down on me because ofmy job situation or income’. These are coded on a5-item scale (where 1 means ‘strongly disagree’ and5 means ‘strongly agree’). Between 2011 and 2016, thechange in trust in institutions differed by perceptions ofsocial exclusion in 11 countries. In nine of thesecountries, trust increased less among those who feltsocially isolated compared to those who perceived lesssocial exclusion. \\nPerceiving tensions between different groups in society\\nis also associated with diminished trust in institutions.The grouping based on the perception of social tensionsis based on a set of items which asks respondentswhether they perceive tensions (‘no tension’, ‘sometension’ or ‘a lot of tension’) in society between the poorand the rich, workers and employers, men and women,old and young, different racial and ethnic groups, anddifferent religious groups. Respondents werecategorised based on the average perceived tensionKey findings on trust in institutions\\nFigure 13: Change in trust in institutions by perception of public service quality, 2011–2016\\n-0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0Czech RepublicPortugalSpainRomaniaGreeceDenmarkIrelandLithuaniaBelgiumGermanyNetherlandsUKCroatiaCyprusFranceSwedenLuxembourgSloveniaFinlandBulgariaPolandEstoniaAustriaLatviaSlovakiaMaltaHungaryItaly\\nChange (high service quality) Change (low service quality) Change (total sample)\\nNotes: Countries are sorted according to the difference in trust between groups perceiving service quality as high and those perceiving it as low.\\nTrust measured on 10-point scale where 1 = ‘do not trust at all’ and 10 = ‘trust completely’.Source: Authors’ calculations based on EQLS  30according to the items.

A statisticallysignificant difference between those perceiving low andhigh social tensions can be found in six countries:France, Cyprus, Slovakia, Germany, Italy and Denmark(in Malta and Estonia the difference is not statisticallysignificant). In all of these cases, the increase in trust ininstitutions is greater among those who perceive a lowlevel of social tension.\\nThe divergences between the categories of the grouping\\nvariables were also studied separately for differenttypes of institutions. In the case of trust in politicalinstitutions and trust in non-political state institutions,perception of social tensions and of public servicequality were the most important grouping variables.These are the variables according to which changes ininstitutional trust differ significantly in the largestSocietal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 14: Change in trust in institutions by perception of social tensions, 2011–2016\\n-0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0FranceCyprusSlovakiaGermanyMaltaItalyEstoniaDenmarkUKLuxembourgPolandIrelandLithuaniaSloveniaAustriaRomaniaFinlandHungaryLatviaSpainNetherlandsBelgiumGreecePortugalSwedenBulgariaCroatiaCzech Republic\\nChange (high social tensions) Change (low social tensions) Change (total sample)\\nNotes: Countries are sorted according to the difference in trust between groups perceiving tensions as high and perceiving low tensions.

In the case of trust in the media,\\nperception of service quality is by far the mostimportant grouping variable within countries. Changesin trust in the media differ by levels of perceived publicservice quality in 17 countries. \\nDifferences in trust – income groups \\nThis section presents differences in trust in institutionsbetween income groups over time, covering bothperiods discussed above. In particular, the resultsconcentrate on the differences in overall trust betweentwo middle income quartiles with a view to determiningwhether or not there is any polarisation between themin this respect. This focus is driven by a growing interestin social inequalities and, in particular, the situation ofthe middle class in Europe, including their perceptionsand views on society as well as on institutions.\\nAs Figure 15 illustrates, trust dynamics for all income\\nquartiles in most countries followed the general patterndiscussed previously: a decrease of trust in institutionsduring the years of economic crisis (2007–2011), and acertain recovery afterwards in 2016. There are notableexceptions, such as an overall trend of declining trust inSpain, with differences between income groupsremaining relatively small. The opposite trend has beencaptured in the UK, with overall trust going up over theperiod discussed. Similarly, there has been a rise in trustin institutions for all income groups in Germany, but inparticular for the third income quartile.\\nIn an earlier section, differences between those with low\\nincomes and high incomes have already beendiscussed, but there is increasing concern also aboutthe polarisation of the middle groups, which meansincreasing distance between upper- and low-middleclasses. Here the focus is whether polarisation of themiddle groups has taken place in terms of overallinstitutional trust. Between 2007 and 2011, astatistically significant difference in the change in trustbetween the middle income quartiles can be seen inseven countries. In Belgium, Sweden, Estonia, Greece,Ireland and Slovenia, polarisation of trust wasidentified, since trust declined more among those in thelower-middle income quartile and the decline was lesspronounced in the upper-middle quartile. The reversepattern was only found in the case of Italy. Between2011 and 2016, four countries – Bulgaria, Austria,Portugal and Italy – had the most important tendenciestowards polarisation. In these countries, institutionaltrust increased more among the upper middle classcompared to the lower middle. France and to someextent Greece and Slovenia are counter-examples, sinceinstitutional trust increased more among the lower-middle groups.As a result of these polarisation tendencies, in 2016 formore countries than previously the differences inoverall trust between the two middle income groups(higher middle or third income quartile, and lowermiddle or second income quartile) are statisticallysignificant, and the differences between third quartileand the second quartile have grown larger – see Table 2.Even though there are nominal differences between themiddle income groups at any point in time, there wereonly five countries in 2007 and four countries in 2011where these differences in overall trust were statisticallysignificant, and in some of those cases it was the lowermiddle income group that had a higher trust than thehigher middle one. By 2016, there were eight countriesin which the trust in institutions by Q3 was higher thantrust by Q2 in a statistically significant way. \\nIt may appear as a paradox that in some countries\\nwhere the overall income inequality, as measured bythe Gini coefficient, is relatively low, the gap betweenthe middle income groups in terms of their trust ininstitutions in 2016 was among the largest, such as inthe Netherlands, Czech Republic, Austria and Germany.On the other hand, some of the literature argues (seeWilkinson and Pickett, 2009) that being at the lowerlevel of the ranking creates feelings of inferiority, whichhas a negative social effect even if the distance betweenthe ranks is not particularly large. In certain countries,this gap in trust levels between the middle incomegroups has persisted over time: at all three points intime in the case of the Netherlands; in 2011 and 2016 inthe case of Ireland. \\nAn exception to the above pattern is the situation\\ncaptured in 2016 in France and Greece, where trust ininstitutions by the higher middle income group (Q3) waslower than that by the lower middle income group (Q2).In France, trust by the higher middle income group (Q3)declined most during 2007–2016 compared to changefor other income quartiles, and was lower than that ofany other income group. \\nThe future exploration of differences in trust levels\\nbetween the middle income groups would benefit fromobservation over a longer time period, and from a moresystematic assessment of how far the higher middleincome groups approximate with the top incomegroups and whether the lower income groups drifttowards the bottom income group – in this case, in theirtrust levels. However, the current results seem to pointto the emergence of a potential trend of polarisationwithin the middle. While this may be country specific,it would seem to call for the general need to monitormore closely not only the inequalities between theextreme ends of the distribution (rich and poor, such asthe S80/S20 measure\\n9) but also those that play out in\\nthe middle.  Key findings on trust in institutions\\n9 The S80/S20 ratio measures the relative disparity in the distribution of a given order of magnitude (wage, income, standard of living, etc.). For an income\\ndistribution, S80/S20 compares the mass of income held by 20% of the richest persons to that held by 20% of the poorest persons.  32Societal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 15: Overall trust in institutions, by income quartile, 2007, 2011 and 2016\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016Austria\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016Denmark\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016FinlandCountries with high levels of institutional trust\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016Luxembourg\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016Netherlands\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016Sweden\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Belgium\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Germany\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016EstoniaCountries with medium levels of institutional trust\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Spain\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016France\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Hungary\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Ireland\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Italy\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Malta\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Portugal\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016United Kingdom\\n1 (lowest income quar/g415le)  2  3  4 (highest income quar/g415le)33Key findings on trust in institutions\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Bulgaria\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Cyprus\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Czech RepublicCountries with low levels of institutional trust\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Greece\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Croatia\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Lithuania\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Latvia\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Poland\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Romania\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Slovenia\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Slovakia\\n1 (lowest income quar/g415le)  2  3  4 (highest income quar/g415le)\\nNotes: Trust measured on 10-point scale where 1 = ‘do not trust at all’ and 10 = ‘trust completely’.

The analysis isbased on EQLS 2007, 2011 and 2016. The independent variables used in the regressionmodels are presented in Tables 3 and 4. The dependentvariable is one of the trust variables defined previously:overall trust in institutions and the variables regardingtrust in different types of institution (trust in politicalinstitutions, trust in non-political state institutions andtrust in the media). As the purpose of the analysis is tostudy determinants of changes in trust in institutions,all relevant individual-level and macro-levelexplanatory variables are included in the model thatwere measured by the survey on more than oneoccasion. Societal change and trust in institutions\\nTable 2: Differences in overall trust between middle income quartiles\\nNotes: Table shows overall trust in five institutions, measured on a 10-point scale. Colour coding indicates the magnitude of difference between Q3\\nand Q2 in a given point of time: red means that Q3 exhibits (much) higher trust than Q2, green means that Q3 has lower trust than Q2. The statisticalsignificance of difference between Q3 and Q2 in a given year is assessed by comparison of means, with two-sided tests assuming equal variances. Forassessing whether a change in trust over time for Q3 and Q2 was different in a statistically significant way, a linear regression model was used, byapplying an interaction of income quartiles with the time dummy. The statistical significance of the coefficient of the interaction is reported.Source: Authors’ calculations based on EQLSCountry Difference in overall trust between Q3 and Q2Difference between change in trust of Q3 and change in\\ntrust of Q2 over respective time periods\\n2007 2011 2016 2011–2007 2016–2011 2016–2007\\nNetherlands 0.6** 0.4** 0.6** -0.2 0.2 0\\nCzech Republic 0.2 0.2 0.5** 0.0 0.3 0.4\\nBulgaria 0.2 -0.2 0.5** -0.4 0.8** 0.3\\nAustria -0.3 -0.1 0.5** 0.2 0.6** 0.7**\\nIreland -0.4 0.5** 0.5** 0.9** 0.0 0.9**\\nGermany 0.1 0.1 0.4** 0.0 0.3* 0.3\\nBelgium -0.2 0.3* 0.3** 0.5** 0.0 0.6**\\nPortugal -0.5** 0.0 0.3* 0.4 0.4 0.8**\\nMalta 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.0 0.3\\nItaly 0.4* 0.0 0.3** -0.5* 0.3** -0.1\\nUnited Kingdom 0.2 0.0 0.3 -0.2 0.3 0.1\\nLuxembourg -0.2 -0.2 0.3 0.0 0.5** 0.5\\nFinland 0.4** 0.3* 0.3* -0.1 0.0 -0.1\\nCyprus -0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.3\\nDenmark 0.3* 0.5** 0.2 0.2 -0.2 -0.1\\nSlovenia -0.3 0.6** 0.2 0.9** -0.4* 0.5*\\nPoland -0.1 -0.1 0.2 0.0 0.3 0.3\\nSlovakia -0.2 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.0 0.4\\nEU28 0.1* 0.1* 0.1** 0.0 0.1* 0.0\\nEstonia -0.2 0.3* 0.1 0.5* -0.2 0.3\\nCroatia 0.4** 0.3 0.1 -0.1 -0.2 -0.3\\nSweden -0.2 0.3* 0.1 0.5** -0.2 0.3\\nRomania 0.4* 0.1 0.1 -0.3 0.0 -0.3\\nSpain 0.0 -0.3* 0.0 -0.3 0.3 0.0\\nLithuania 0.1 0.1 -0.2 0.0 -0.3 -0.3\\nLatvia 0.4* 0.1 -0.3 -0.3 -0.4 -0.7**\\nHungary -0.1 0.3 -0.3 0.3 -0.5* -0.2\\nGreece -0.6** 0.1 -0.4** 0.7** -0.5** 0.2\\nFrance 0.2 0.1 -0.5** -0.1 -0.6** -0.7**35In the following analysis, multilevel random intercept\\nregression models are used to study the effect ofindependent variables. Multilevel models are suitablefor analysis of the data at hand because they take intoaccount the correlation between individuals from thesame country. These models allow for the introductionof group-level explanatory variables. They also allow forthe estimation of correct standard errors for thesevariables (Snijders and Bosker, 2012). As the data usedfor the purpose of this report include individualrespondents from different countries and there aresurveys from multiple years for each country,three-level multilevel models are used.\\n10In the following model, all variables (dependent andindependent) are centred to the grand mean (in otherwords, the EU average of the given variable).  \\nFigure 16 shows what effect various factors have on\\noverall trust in institutions. The effect size shown isbased on standardised coefficients of explanatoryvariables; standardisation is important since variableswith different measurement scales are being compared,and in this way of presenting, the effect sizes arecomparable to each other.\\n11Key findings on trust in institutions\\nTable 3:  Individual-level independent variables\\nVariables Details\\nDemographic Gender, age, urbanisation (countryside; village; medium town; city or suburb), health\\nproblems (self-rated health: bad or very bad), living alone in the household\\nSocioeconomic Education (lower secondary or below, upper secondary, tertiary), labour market status(employed, retired, unemployed/inactive), income (quartiles of equivalised householdincome)\\nPerception of the quality of public services Average of five EQLS items (see p. 28)\\nPerception of social exclusion Average of four EQLS items (see p. 29)\\nPerception of social tension Average of six EQLS items (see p. 29)\\nThree additional variables for the second sub-period (2011–2016)\\nPerception of change in own financialsituation Those reporting that their financial situation had become worse in response to the followingquestion: ‘When you compare the financial situation of your household 12 months ago andnow, would you say it has become better, worse or remained the same?’ (Q98)\\nSatisfaction with economic situation of thecountrySimilar questions were asked in the EQLS in 2011 and 2016, albeit with slightly differentwording (Q32 in 2016: satisfaction with the present state of the economy in country; Q40h in2011: satisfaction with the economic situation in country) and as part of a series of differentsatisfaction items.

Standard deviation measures the average distance ofindividual values of a given variable from the mean of its distribution.    36Results show that individual characteristics such as\\ngender, age, education, income, health andurbanisation level affect trust. More specifically, womenhave more trust in institutions in general than men.Age has a non-linear effect on overall trust ininstitutions: the middle-aged have less confidence thanthe youngest age group (16–24 years old), while amongthe elderly trust in institutions is greater than amongthe young and the middle-aged. Health problems andliving in large cities or towns have a negative effect ontrust in institutions. Trust in institutions is also relatedto social status: those with a lower education level orlow income have significantly less confidence ininstitutions than those with high education or incomelevels. For example, all else being equal, having beenthrough tertiary education increases trust in institutionsby 0.35 points (on scale 1-10) compared to those withprimary education. \\nHowever, the other individual-level predictors that have\\nbiggest impact on overall trust in institutions are theperception of quality of public services and socialtensions perceived. Perception of quality of publicservices is strongly associated with trust in institutions:a one standard deviation increase in the perceivedquality of public services increases trust in institutionsby 0.78 points. It is also clear from the regression resultsthat lack of social cohesion is associated with low trustin institutions. When there is one standard deviationincrease in perceived social tensions in society, overalltrust in institutions declines by 0.27 points.\\nAmong the macro-level variables, government integrity,\\nas measured by the Corruption Perceptions Index, andGDP per capita has a significant positive effect on trustin institutions, while income inequality and austerityhas no effect. If the Corruption Perceptions Index wereto increase by one standard deviation (meaning thatcorruption is seen as getting lower), the overall trustin institutions would become higher by 0.3 points(on a scale of 1–10). \\nA further advanced analysis was carried out to examine\\nin what way the country-level factors, such ascorruption and GDP, affect trust: whether it isabsolute levels (in other words, what is the effect ofbetween-country variation) or the within-countrySocietal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 16: Effects of individual-level and macro-level variables on trust in institutions \\n4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6 4.8 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.6 5.8Perceived quality of public servicesTertiary education (ref.

For continuous variables (e.g. quality\\nof public services), the difference of the predicted value and the EU average of trust shows the change in trust in institutions when the variable isincreased by one standard deviation. For dummy or categorical variables (these have a reference category identified in parentheses), thedifference shows how trust by a given category of people differs from the reference category. Only those factors are displayed whose effect onoverall trust is statistically significant; for a full set of variables examined, see Table A2 in the Annex. Effects of independent variables wereestimated using random intercept models on pooled data from EQLS 2007, 2011 and 2016. N=87,075. Full details of the estimation can be seen inTable A2 in the Annex.  Source: Authors’ calculations based on EQLS  37progress over time that counts. The results show that in\\nthe case of perceived corruption, the effect oninstitutional trust is mostly related to the differencesbetween countries: institutional trust tends to be higherin countries with higher average levels of CPI (that is,lower perceived corruption). An increase in governmentintegrity (increase of CPI) over time also has a positivecoefficient on institutional trust, but it is not statisticallysignificant. However, with regard to drawingconclusions, one should consider that perhaps thewithin-country changes in CPI over the period examinedwere not large enough or that longer periods areneeded for CPI to change in order to have an impact ontrust levels.\\nIn contrast, in the case of GDP per capita, the changes\\nwithin countries over time have a significant effect ontrust in institutions: in years when the GDP is higherinstitutional trust also tends to be higher. On the otherhand, the advanced analysis confirms that incomeinequality and austerity do not seem to significantlyaffect trust in institutions\\n12. \\nThe importance of independent variables was alsoinvestigated separately for two sub-periods: the crisisyears (2007–2011) and the following years (2011–2016).Among the macro-level variables, the level of theCorruption Perceptions Index significantly affects trustin institutions during the crisis years, while within-country differences in corruption over time seem to beimportant in the second sub-period that followed theeconomic crisis. During the crisis years, changes in GDPper capita also have an effect on trust in institutions,but this was not the case during the 2011-2016 period. \\nResults show that individual-level variables have similar\\neffects in the two periods (see more details in technicalreport). The data available from EQLS 2011 and 2016also allowed us to include additional control variablesin the model for the second sub-period. Among these,satisfaction with the economy of the countrysignificantly increases trust in institutions. Those whosaw their financial situation worsening during the yeartend to have lower levels of trust in institutions. Theanalysis also found that religious observance isassociated with trust in institutions, with those definedas being religious tending to have greater trust ininstitutions.\\nPatterns of correlations detected in the case of trust in\\npolitical institutions and trust in non-political stateinstitutions are similar to those described above in thecase of overall institutional trust (based on analysis ofthe pooled data of EQLS 2007, 2011 and 2016; see TableA3 in Annex). An important difference is that corruptionseems to be important in the case of trust in politicalinstitutions, but in the case of trust in non-political stateinstitutions and trust in the media, corruptionperception does not appear to have any effect. \\nMultivariate analysis of trust in the EU\\nBased on Eurobarometer data, this section analyseschanges in trust in the EU by taking into accountindividual-level and macro-level factors. It alsoexamines how far the results are in line with thoseobtained for trust in national institutions from theEQLS data.\\nThe first set of analysis looks at the effect of\\nindividual-level variables for four different years: 2004,2007, 2011 and 2016. The variables described below areincluded in logistic regression models of trust in the EU.\\nThe Eurobarometer data do not include income or the\\nhighest education level attained by individuals but theydo include employment status and occupation.Accordingly, these two variables – employment statusand occupation – are used as the proxy for the level ofeducational attainment and income. It is assumed thatthe higher the level of the occupation of the person(in terms of the skills and qualifications needed), thehigher their level of education and income. Those out ofwork are assumed to have a lower level of educationand income than those in work.\\nRecent literature on trust in EU institutions includes a\\ndiscussion of other socioeconomic and political factorsthat are likely to influence a person’s level of trust inthese institutions. Some of these factors include: theperson’s assessment of the economic situation; theirperception of whether or not the EU is doing somethingfor people; whether or not they are interested in EUpolitical affairs; and their awareness and knowledge ofthe EU. Questions on each of these aspects are regularlyincluded in the Eurobarometer surveys.\\nTable A4 in the Annex shows two sets of logistic\\nregression models where the dependent variable is thebinary indicator of ‘trust in the EU’ and the independentvariables are individual characteristics, describedabove, as well as country dummies. It should be notedthat the variable ‘trust in the national government’ isincluded in the second set of models but not in the firstset. \\nThe results obtained for trust in national institutions\\nindicate that women are more inclined to trust nationalinstitutions than men. However, this does not appear toapply to trust in the EU: only for the 2016 findings dowomen have a statistically significant greater level ofKey findings on trust in institutions\\n12 The same conclusions are obtained as a result of both the regression analysis based on a random intercept multilevel model and the OLS regression\\nmodel with country-fixed effects.   38trust in the EU than men. And the relationship between\\ntrust in the EU and age differs from that observed fortrust in national institutions. Those aged 15–24 tend totrust in the EU more than both the other age groups, afinding in line with the literature. This might beexplained by the fact that people under 25 are generallymore optimistic about the future and that they benefitfrom, and appreciate, more European programmes(such as the Erasmus programme). In 2007, 64% of thisage group trusted the EU compared with 47% in 2016.By contrast, the majority of those aged 55+ tend not totrust the EU (European Commission, 2017a). It is likelythat these people do not necessarily see the advantagesof EU integration, are more sceptical about the EU or aregenerally more pessimistic about the future. Inparticular, those aged 65+ have always had the lowestlevels of trust in the EU compared to other age groups,and have shown a large decline in trust since the onsetof the crisis: just 28% had confidence in the EU at thebeginning of 2016 compared with 50% at the beginningof 2007. However, the largest decline in trust wasamong those aged 25–49 and 50–54 (-24 percentagepoints in each case). This is relevant because both agegroups had high levels of trust in the EU in 2007(59% and 54% respectively).\\nMoreover, also in line with the results published\\npreviously (European Commission, 2017a), men, thosewith higher levels of education, students and managersare more likely to trust the EU than other groups. This isalso in line with the results obtained for trust in nationalinstitutions: the lower the level of education, the lowerthe level of trust.\\nResults also show that EU citizens are less likely to trust\\nin the EU when they perceive that the economicsituation in their country might get worse or is unlikelyto improve, or when they do not understand how the EUworks. On the other hand, they are more likely to trustin the EU when they do not consider the EU to impairtheir cultural identity.\\nAs discussed previously, trust in the national\\ngovernment seems to influence the level of trust peoplehave in the EU. Those who do not have confidence intheir national government are significantly less likely totrust the EU; and this was particularly the case duringthe crisis period.\\nWhile it seems that trust in the EU has increased in the\\nUK since the Brexit referendum (Batsaikhan and Darvas,2017), after accounting for all individual variables,figures show that the UK has almost always been theMember State with the lowest level of trust in the EU.The only exceptions were in 2004, when levels of trustwere lower in Finland and Sweden, and in 2007, whenthey were lower in Austria.\\nThe second analysis also takes into account macro-level\\nvariables that might influence trust in the EU. To fullyprofit from the rich data at hand, a pseudo-paneldataset was constructed from the waves of theEurobarometer study. The study does not follow thesame individuals over time, so it is not possible toconduct an individual-level panel analysis. However, thedata do allow the creation of groups (cohorts), whichcan be followed across specific periods. The methodadopted combines pseudo-panel data with fixed effectmodels, which allows to adjust for all omitted but fixeddifferences between cohorts that affect trust in the EU.(For more details about the methodology of theanalysis, see the technical report). \\nFour models have been tested, in all of which the\\ndependent variable is the level of trust in the EU. Models1 and 1\\' do not include the micro-level variable ‘trust innational government’, whereas Models 2 and 2\\' do.In addition, Models 1\\' and 2\\' take into account the yearsfollowing the onset of the economic crisis to seewhether this has an impact on the level of trust in theEU. Table 5 presents the findings of the analysis, whichindicate that trust in the EU is positively andsignificantly influenced by people’s understanding ofhow the EU works and a belief that EU membershipdoes not impair cultural identity. The fact that peoplebelieve that the economic situation in their country willimprove is only a significant factor when trust innational government is not included in the model.Otherwise, trust in national government seems to be themain explanatory micro-level variable.\\nAmong the country level variables, the level of\\nperceived corruption, as measured by the CorruptionPerceptions Index, does not seem to affect the level oftrust in the EU. This is confirmed for the Member Statesthat joined after 2004, when ‘number of years spent inEU membership’ is included in the two models (seetechnical report for details). In this case, however, therelationship between the number of years of EUmembership and the proportion of people trusting theEU is negative (but it is difficult to make a distinctionbetween the impact of EU accession and that of theeconomic crisis as they overlap in time).\\nIn addition, the proportion of non-nationals in the\\ncountry seems to play a significant role, particularly inModels 2 and 2\\' where trust in the national governmentis taken into account. This suggests that the relativenumber of non-nationals in a country does notnecessarily affect the level of trust in the EU. \\nFigures also confirm that the level of trust in the EU\\ndeclined significantly in the years following the onset ofthe crisis (as indicated in the sections above). However,economic growth does not seem to have a significantinfluence on the level of trust in the EU, which might beexplained by growth after the crisis not being highenough or sustained enough to restore such trust or byother factors that come into play. On the other hand,high unemployment in a country is associated withfewer people having confidence in the EU. \\nSocietal change and trust in institutions39Consequences of changes in\\ntrust levels\\nThis section examines some possible consequences of\\ntrust. As the literature review mentions, previousstudies suggest that trust in institutions may: providethe necessary political support for policy reforms; makepolicy implementation, including tax enforcement,more effective; and spur political engagement. Thissection provides some preliminary empirical analysisconcerning these claims.Trust and EU policy reforms\\nThe relationship between the level of support forEU reforms and the degree of trust in EU institutions isexamined based on Eurobarometer data analysis inTable 6. Figures for the EU overall show a strongpositive and significant relationship over the period2004–2017 between trust in EU institutions and supportfor reforms, specifically the single currency, a commonforeign policy, a common defence policy and future EUenlargement. When trust in the EU increases, supportfor the proposed reforms increases as well, andconversely when trust declines, support for theproposed reforms decreases. This is particularly true forEU enlargement, and to a lesser extent with regard to acommon defence policy (Figure 17). The consequencesof an increase in trust in the EU therefore vary accordingto the areas of reform concerned.

For example, in 2016,someone expressing trust in the EU was 2.7 times morelikely to support the single currency than someone whodoes not have such trust and three times more likely tosupport a common foreign policy (see separatetechnical report). In all countries, those who haveconfidence in the EU are more likely to support reformsthan those with limited confidence, but the scale of thelikelihood differs markedly between countries, as wellas between the reforms in question. For example, in2016, those with confidence in the EU in Greece werealmost nine times more likely to support the singlecurrency than those with low trust, whereas in Denmarkand Sweden (countries which do not belong to the eurozone), those expressing trust in the EU were only aroundtwice as likely to support a single currency than others.In addition, in Greece, those with confidence in the EUwere only just over twice as likely to supportEU enlargement than others, considerably less than thelikelihood in respect of the single currency or commonforeign and defence policies (around eight times morelikely and ten times more likely than others,respectively). \\nBetween 2004 and 2016, however, these odds ratios\\ndeclined in the EU as a whole, meaning that thelikelihood of those having confidence in the EU alsosupporting reforms was less in 2016 than 12 yearsearlier. This was particularly for the single currency: theodds ratio declined from 3.7 to 2.7. On the other hand,although the odds ratio declined in most countries, itincreased in a significant minority of countries. Therewas, therefore, no common tendency for those withconfidence in the EU to become less supportive ofreforms than other people across the EU. In 2016, in theCzech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Italy and Lithuania, thelikelihood that those who had confidence in the EUwould also support a single currency and commonforeign and defence policies was greater than in 2004.Accordingly, in these countries, it was increasingly thecase that those supporting these three policies werepeople with confidence in the EU.

In these countries, euro-scepticism is relatively widespread, at least atgovernment level (especially in Poland and Slovakia),but an above average proportion of the population trustthe EU. Between 2004 and 2016, the likelihood thatthose trusting the EU also support the single currencyincreased significantly in three of the countries,Hungary being the exception, while the proportionsupporting a common foreign policy rose significantly inthe Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, butremained unchanged in Poland. Those with confidencein the EU were also more likely to support a commondefence policy in 2016 than in 2004 in all four countries,but less likely to support future enlargement in three ofthem, the exception in this case being Slovakia, wherethe proportion of those expressing support increasedduring the period 2004–2016. Overall, it can beconcluded that there was a widespread, though by nomeans common, tendency for the link between trust inthe EU and support for reforms to weaken over theperiod.\\nTrust and tax compliance\\nStudies of trust and tax compliance generally useattitudinal data to explore the association betweentrust and tax compliance motives. Instead, Figure 18shows the association between trust attitudesand an ‘objective’ measure of tax avoidance: thevalue-added tax (VAT) gap, defined as the differencebetween expected VAT and VAT revenues collected in agiven country. Note that factors other than fraud andtax evasion (like bankruptcies, financial insolvenciesand miscalculations) also affect the size of the VAT gap.\\nAs shown by Figure 18, there is a strong negative\\nassociation between levels of trust in institutions andKey findings on trust in institutions\\nRO\\nEL\\nSICZLTLV\\nIT\\nES PT\\nFRUKSK\\nPLHU\\nIEMT\\nBG\\nDEBEDK\\nNLEE\\nAT\\nFISELU\\n0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%\\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80%VAT gap, 2011\\nTrust in government, 2011 (%)Figure 18: Trust in institutions and the VAT gap: association between levels and changes, 2011–2015 \\nNote: VAT gap expressed as percentage of VAT total theoretical liability (see CASE and IHS, 2017).  \\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on EQLSESIT\\nSIPT FR\\nCYPL\\nHRBG\\nLVRO\\nEL\\nIECZSK\\nLT\\nHU\\nUK\\nATBE\\nEEDEDK\\nNL\\nSEMT\\nFI\\nLU\\n-5%0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%\\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%VAT gap, 2015\\nTrust in government, 2015 (%)\\nATBE\\nBGCZDE\\nDK\\nEEEL\\nESFIFR\\nHUIEIT LTLU\\nLV\\nMTNLPL\\nPTRO\\nSESISKUK\\n-20-15-10-505\\n-20 -10 0 10 20 30Percentage point change in the VAT gap\\nPercentage point change in trust in government42the size of VAT gaps in 2011. The same pattern is\\nobservable in 2015, although the strength of theassociation is weaker and the deviation from the trendline is larger. The association between changes in bothtrust in institutions and VAT gap indicators is alsonegative, although quite weak. However, a few outliersmight have a considerable effect on the weakness of theassociation. Overall, it can be said that trust ininstitutions and the VAT gap show the expectedassociation, both in terms of the cross-sectional and thelongitudinal analysis.Trust and political activity\\nPolitical science literature underlines the complexrelationship between trust in political institutions andpolitical participation (see for instance, Gabriel, 2017).According to the culturalist approach to democracy,political trust and participation are both part of the civicculture that supports democracy, while another strandof research examines political trust as the predictor ofpolitical participation. The understanding of trust as apredictor of political participation suggests that thosewho have low trust in political institutions or leadersSocietal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 19: Proportion of those with low trust in political institutions and no political participation,\\n2011 and 2016 (%)\\n0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0FinlandNetherlandsSwedenLuxembourgDenmarkBelgiumAustriaGermanyUKMaltaIrelandEstoniaFrancePortugalHungarySlovakiaCzech RepublicItalyCyprusLithuaniaPolandSpainLatviaRomaniaSloveniaCroatiaBulgariaGreece\\n2011 2016\\nNote: Countries are sorted according to data in 2016. For more details, see Table A5 of the Annex.\\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on EQLS  43would engage less in conventional forms of political\\naction but could be more willing to participate in otherforms of participation (such as political protests).Without intending to analyse the causal connectionbetween political trust and participation, theassociation of the two will be described in this section.The motivation for this is that the decline in trust ininstitutions could be considered as less problematic if itdoes not go together with a decline of politicalparticipation. If the erosion of trust is accompanied byan increase in political engagement, this may be anindication of the rise of critical citizens who give voice totheir discontent. On the other hand, if falling trust ininstitutions is coupled with decreasing politicalparticipation, then one may assume that politicalcynicism prevails. \\nFor the purpose of this analysis, political participation is\\nbased on four items that are present in both EQLS 2011and 2016: ‘attended a meeting of a trade union, politicalparty or political action group’; ‘attended a protest ordemonstration’; ‘contacted a politician or publicofficial’; and ‘signed a petition, including onlinepetition’. If the respondent had participated in any ofthese activities they were coded as politically active,otherwise they were considered politically inactive. Figure 19 shows the percentage of those who did nottrust the political institutions and did not participate inpolitics in 2011 and 2016. There is a huge differencebetween the Member States in the percentage of peoplewho are characterised by low trust (who score 4 orlower on the 10-point trust in institutions scale) and donot participate in politics. In the Member States insouth-eastern Europe, the percentage is above 50%,while in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands andLuxembourg it is below 10%. The percentage of thosewith low levels of trust and no political participationdeclined in an overwhelming majority of the countries(22 out of 28 countries) between 2011 and 2016. Themost important exceptions are France, Spain andCroatia. The main driver of this decline has beenincreasing political trust during this period, however ina smaller number of countries increasing participationamong those with low trust also contributed (see moredetails in Table A5 in the Annex). In Austria, Belgium,Finland, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia andthe UK, political participation actually increased amongthose with low levels of political trust. In this group ofcountries, there is thus a sign of a rising critical citizenphenomenon. In another group of countries however,consisting of Greece, Cyprus, Spain, the Czech Republic,Croatia and Romania, political participation declinedamong those with low levels of political trust.\\nKey findings on trust in institutions45This report presents the findings of an analysis of the\\ndynamics of trust in institutions in EU countries duringthe past 15 years. The study uses rich repeatedcross-sectional data from the EQLS and Eurobarometersurvey to observe changes of trust in institutions duringthis period. There are, of course, limitations of thestudy, one of which is the lack of individual panel datato study the dynamics of trust in institutions.Furthermore, although the data allow to take intoaccount important determinants of trust in institutions(like perceptions of the quality of public services orsocial tensions), some other determinants identified inthe literature (for instance, Murtin et al, 2018) have notbeen measured or, at least, not at different time pointsin the data used. These include potential determinantssuch as a migrant background or political preferences.This has limited the authors’ capacity to explore issueslike the effect of migration or political polarisation onchanges of trust in institutions. \\nThe results validate the initial assumptions about the\\ncomplex, context-dependent and dynamic nature oftrust in institutions. Despite the generalisations thatoccur sometimes in the scholarly literature and, moreoften, in the media about the crisis of trust, data show amore differentiated picture. Still, the following pointspresent an overview of the most important and, inseveral respects, novel results of this research.\\nDecline in trust is temporary and variable\\nThe review of the trends in trust in institutions since thebeginning of the century does not reveal a uniformtendency of declining trust in national institutions inMember States. Looking at three waves of EQLS dataalso suggests that the decline in trust in institutionsduring the crisis years has been a temporaryphenomenon in many countries: between 2011 and2016 trust in institutions increased (although it did notoften return to pre-crisis levels). The dynamics of trustin EU countries since the beginning of the century canvary by type of institution, by sub-period and bycountry.\\nNational political institutions most affected\\nTrust in national political institutions (parliament andgovernment institutions) was most affected by thecrisis: it declined significantly during the crisis years butbounced back afterwards in many countries. Trust inthe legal system and the police is somewhat greater inEU countries compared to trust in political institutions,and changes in trust in these institutions have beenmore moderate. During the crisis years, the fall in trustin non-political state institutions was smaller than thefall in trust in political institutions, but during thesecond sub-period (2011–2016) the increase in trust wasalso more moderate.Patterns of trust differ across EUTrust dynamics and itineraries differ considerablyacross Europe. Overall, trust in institutions has beenmore volatile in southern and eastern Europeancountries as well as in Ireland, but has remained more\\nstable in western and northern European countries andthe Baltic states. Most countries experienced somedecline around the time of the economic crisis, but trustthen more or less bounced back in most cases.However, some eastern and southern Europeancountries have experienced a slow and continuousdecline in trust levels. \\nTrust in the EU declined in a majority of countries\\n(20 out of 28), and only a minority of countries saw aflat-lining or an increase of trust in the EU over the\\nperiod. Trust in the EU also followed differenttrajectories across countries. On average it declined overthe period, as the deterioration in trust was followed bya more modest recovery, although there have beensome recent improvements. This is largely due to thedynamic in eastern European countries, where generallygreater trust in the EU has moved closer to the levels ofconfidence in national institutions, although trust in theEU still remains higher than trust in national institutionsacross the eastern Member States.\\nRole of key factors\\nAnother aim of the present report is to uncover thefactors driving change in trust in institutions. Theinvestigation of differences in trust dynamics betweensocial groups shows that in the crisis sub-period (2007–2011), the most important differences were attributableto education level and income status. The decline intrust was more significant among those in low-statuspositions (for instance, low education or low income).During the post-crisis sub-period (2011–2016), the mostimportant grouping variable was perceived quality ofpublic services. In every country where significantdifferences were found, there was a noticeably greaterincrease in trust among those who perceived the qualityof public services to be high compared to those whoperceived low service quality.\\nThe multivariate analysis of drivers of trust in national\\ninstitutions confirms the effect of perceptions of public\\nservice quality on trust in institutions. The analysishighlights that trust in institutions also relates toindicators of social cohesion. The perception of tensionin society and the feeling of social exclusion decreasestrust in institutions. Among the macro-level variables,the impact of corruption on trust is the most robust\\nresult. Respondents living in countries with higher levelsof perceived corruption have less trust in institutions,and increases in perceived corruption are associatedwith a decline in trust in institutions. During the crisis\\n3Conclusions  46period, within-country changes in GDP per capita also\\nproved to have an effect on trust in institutions. Theeffect of income inequality on trust features only in\\ncross-sectional analysis of the years following the crisis,and not in later years.\\nIn the case of drivers of trust in the EU, the report\\nreveals that EU citizens are less likely to trust in the EU ifthey think that the economic situation in their country\\nmay get worse or if they think it is unlikely to improve,or if they do not understand how the EU works. On theother hand, they are more likely to have confidence inthe EU if they do not consider it to impair their culturalidentity. However, the level of perceived corruptiondoes not seem to affect the level of trust in the EU.\\nThe relationship between the proportion of people with\\nconfidence in national institutions and the proportionwith confidence in EU institutions is positive in themajority of countries for the period 2004–2017.Therefore, an increase in the proportion of people thattrust national institutions is linked with an increase inthe share of people that trust EU institutions and,conversely, a decline in trust in national institutions is\\nlinked with a decline in trust in EU institutions. In\\naddition, substitution effects are evident in a fewcountries in the case of specific EU institutions. The dataalso suggests that there may be a blame-shifting effectin some countries to a certain extent, with trust in theEU declining more considerably than trust in thenational government.\\nPolicy pointers\\nThere are a number of positive practical consequencesof public trust in institutions, some of which areexamined in this report. First, since trust essentiallyinvolves expectations concerning the future, itstabilises social interactions as it lowers transaction\\ncosts and increases predictability. Stable andtrustworthy state institutions are an importantcondition for the development of the private sector.Second, if people have confidence in institutions, theyare more likely to be amenable to policy reforms, evencostly or risky ones. This report demonstrates that theassociation between trust and support for reforms alsoholds in the case of the EU institutions. Third, trustmakes policy implementation easier as people are\\nmore willing to obey state authorities and the law, paytaxes or take part in collective action. This report findsthat in countries with more confidence in institutions,tax evasion is lower. Additionally, a decrease in trustmay lead to increased support for populist and radicalparties. \\nDespite the recent worries expressed publicly about the\\ndecline of trust in institutions and spreading discontentand cynicism, data show that the erosion of publicconfidence is not irreversible. This is an importantpolicy message. However, it is also apparent thatpatterns of trust dynamics differ considerably acrosscountries and the factors behind this vary. In otherwords, there is no ‘quick fix’ nor a ‘one-size-fits-all’solution to the problem of trust. Politicians andpolicymakers should design targeted programmes to\\ncope with the specific challenges in the given country orin a given context.\\nDespite the complex and context-bound nature of trust\\nin institutions, some general recommendations can bedrawn from this analysis. Improving macroeconomicconditions and increasing incomes are certainlyimportant ways of improving trust; however, in contrastto some widespread opinions, economic conditions arenot the only factor at play. Some Member States that\\nunderwent austerity measures during the crisismanaged to do so without much decline in trust ininstitutions. Focusing on the most vulnerable groups insociety, improving social cohesion, reducing incomeinequalities and moderating social tensions can help torecover and further build trust. Improving the quality ofpublic services is also a key factor in strengthening trust\\nin governments. Finally, public confidence requirescorruption control measures and the promotion ofpublic integrity.\\nEducation is also beneficial for trust: people that are\\nmore educated generally have more confidence inpublic institutions. This applies to the case of trust inthe EU as well. Moreover, people who are moreknowledgeable about EU institutions express moreconfidence towards the EU. Since trust in the EU hasconsiderably diminished in eastern European countrieswhere education levels are relatively lower, andknowledge about how democracy works in the EU is stilllimited, one potential policy initiative is to focus oneffective information flows and communication aboutthe EU, especially in eastern European Member States.\\nPeople are more inclined to trust the EU if they believe\\nthat the EU does not impair their cultural identity. Achallenge for European policymakers and (national)politicians is to find a way to balance a clear expressionof European values and respect for national and localcultures.\\nTo sum up, trust in institutions provides a useful policy\\ntool for measuring the legitimacy of, and support for,public institutions. Governments and internationalbodies should consider regular and high-quality datacollection about trust in institutions and related\\nvariables concerning public perceptions of theeffectiveness, integrity and normative legitimacy ofinstitutional operation. Policymakers would benefitfrom understanding and promoting trust by regularlymeasuring and examining its (often very specific andcontext dependent) roots so that appropriate measurescan be taken to nurture trust.Societal change and trust in institutions47Acemoglu, D. and Robinson, J.A.

In some Member States, trustin the EU declined more during this period thantrust in national governments, but trust in the EUhas generally remained higher than trust innational governments in most countries. Thereport shows that moderating social tensions andfeelings of social exclusion can help to stem thedecline in trust. However, to boost trust ininstitutions, improving the quality of publicservices is the most powerful driver. A number ofencouraging and practical consequences resultfrom trust in public institutions: for example,countries with higher trust in political institutionshave a lower level of tax evasion (VAT gap) andgreater public support for policy reforms.   \\nThe European Foundation for the Improvement of\\nLiving and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is atripartite European Union Agency whose role is toprovide knowledge in the area of social,employment and work-related policies.Eurofound was established in 1975 by CouncilRegulation (EEC) No. 1365/75 to contribute to theplanning and design of better living and workingconditions in Europe.TJ-03-18-485-EN-N\\nISBN: 978-92-897-1796-0\\ndoi:10.2806/736845\\n\\nRESEARCH REPORT\\nSocietal change and \\ntrust in institutionsQuality of life Societal change and \\ntrust in institutions\\nEuropean Foundation\\nfor the Improvement ofLiving and WorkingConditionsEurope Direct is a service to help you find answers to your questions about the European Union.\\nFreephone number*: 00 800 6 7 8 9 10 11\\n*Certain mobile telephone operators do not allow access to 00 800 numbers or these calls may be billed.

Whilesome citizens and political interests blamed the EU forthe problems caused by the economic crisis, a decline intrust in national governments was also apparent. \\nBased on analysis of data from the European Quality of\\nLife Survey (EQLS) and Eurobarometer studies, thisreport seeks to broaden the understanding of trends intrust in institutions. The focus is on patterns of changesince the turn of this century, and possible explanationsfor these patterns at national and EU level. The reportalso seeks to identify the societal groups for whom trusthas declined the most, paying particular attention tothe relationship between confidence in nationalinstitutions and in the EU. Finally, it examines theimplications for policy of changes in trust.\\nPolicy context\\nDeclining trust in institutions is problematic for severalreasons. Trust partly reflects good institutionalperformance; it is also an essential precondition foreffective governance. Trust in governmental institutionscan increase compliance with regulations. Trust ingovernment authorities increases willingness to paytaxes, and may enable authorities to implementstructural reforms with short-term costs, but long-termbenefits. In countries where trust in institutions islimited, citizens might prioritise political candidateswho promise immediate benefits, creatingopportunities for populist and radical parties andpoliticians, whose promised quick fixes may not actuallysolve complex problems.\\nKey findings\\nSince 2001 there has been no uniform tendency ofdeclining trust in national institutions in Member States.Data from the EQLS suggest that, in many countries,decline in trust in institutions was a temporaryphenomenon during the recession. Meanwhile, trust inthe EU remained generally greater than trust in nationalgovernments in most countries during the crisis period. Trust in national institutions was generally more volatilein southern and eastern Europe, and more stable inwestern and northern Europe and in the Baltic States.In general, trust in national institutions had fullyrecovered for most of the EU by 2016; however, in anumber of countries, such as some southern MemberStates, it has not returned to precrisis levels. Lowerlevels of trust still characterise a number of easternEuropean countries.\\nTrust in national political institutions was most affected\\nby the crisis. Changes in trust in non-politicalinstitutions (legal system and police) as well as in mediawere smaller.\\nBetween 2001 and 2016, trust in the EU institutions also\\ndeclined but, in most countries, it is still greater than intrust in national governments. The relationshipbetween trust in national institutions and trust inEU institutions is generally positive: an increase in trustin national institutions is linked with an increase intrusting in EU institutions. In some countries, however,trust in the EU declined more significantly during thecrisis years than trust in national governments –a possible blame-shifting effect.\\nThe uneven distribution of trust within countries\\n(trust inequality) has generally not changed over time.However, during the crisis, people in low-statuspositions experienced a greater decline in trust innational institutions. And levels of trust recovered moreamong those who were positive about the quality ofpublic services. \\nDecrease in trust may be less problematic if it is not a\\npart of democratic disengagement and politicalcynicism. In eight Member States, political participationactually increased among those with low trust inpolitical institutions. In the majority of countries,however, political participation either declined orremained at the same levels among those who tend notto trust political institutions.\\nThere is increasing concern also about the potential rise\\nin income inequalities, as well as the polarisation ofsociety. This report examined how differences betweenupper- and lower-middle classes changed over time.Between 2007 and 2011, polarisation between themiddle income quartiles in terms of overall trust ininstitutions occurred in six countries, with levelsdeclining more among those in the lower-middleincome quartile and less in the upper-middle incomequartile. Between 2011 and 2016, there was a greaterincrease in trust among those in the upper-middleincome quartile in four countries.Executive summary2Policy pointers\\n£ Despite worries over declining trust in public\\ninstitutions, it seems that the erosion of publicconfidence is not irreversible. However, as trustdynamics differ considerably across countries,measures appropriate to specific contexts have tobe sought.\\n£ Understanding the drivers of trust is key to devisingappropriate measures that can boost trust levels. \\n£ Improving macroeconomic performance andincreasing incomes are important ways of boostingtrust; however, monetary improvements are not theonly factor. Institutional integrity as evidenced byperception of low corruption helps to sustain trust,while failure to curtail corruption is associated witha decline in trust.\\n£ Addressing the quality of public services is a keymeans of boosting overall trust in institutions. Thepublic services in question include health and careservices – a broader set of services to the publicthan the direct functions of national politicalinstitutions.£ Moderating societal tensions and reducing feelingsof social exclusion can help prevent a decline intrust.\\n£ Monitoring the extent of political participation anddisengagement among groups who display limitedtrust can give policymakers useful information increating opportunities for dialogue betweencitizens and institutions. \\n£ At individual level, education is an important factor:people with higher levels of education generallyhave more confidence in public institutions,including EU institutions. Countries or groups insociety with a lower level of education therefore areimportant priorities when designing and targetingpublic awareness programmes, nationally or withthe EU institutions in mind.\\n£ Trust in public institutions brings a number ofpositive practical consequences. The extent of taxevasion is lower in countries with greater trust inpolitical institutions. Trust in institutions predicts asupportive attitude to policy reforms, includingpolicies of EU-level relevance, such as the singlecurrency, common foreign and defence policy, andenlargement. Societal change and trust in institutions3The decade since the Great Recession has been\\ncharacterised by critics as a period of ‘crisis of trust’ inEuropean societies (Hosking, 2017). Following theeconomic crisis that hit Europe in 2008, whengovernments struggled to curb unemployment, managepublic debt and emerge from the economic downturn,trust in national political institutions fell in manycountries. The crisis also had an effect on trust in EUinstitutions. \\nIn the European context, the erosion of trust in\\ninstitutions has given rise to questions about thepotential impact on political and social stability, as wellas implications for the development of Europeanintegration. Some blamed the EU for the problemscreated by the economic crisis that affected citizens.However, a decline in trust in national governments wasconsiderable; in fact, trust in the EU generally remainedgreater than trust in national governments in most EUMember States during the crisis period. \\nThe decline in trust in institutions was partly due to the\\neconomic crisis itself. The 2008 recession brought abouthigher levels of unemployment, increasingprecariousness and declining real incomes in a majorityof Member States. The consequences of this economiccrisis have shaped the perceptions of institutionalperformance among the populations affected(Eurofound, 2013b). Young people and those living insouthern European Member States were particularlyaffected during this period (Eurofound, 2017; Medgyesi,2018). Controversies over the management of theeconomic crisis also had a negative impact onconfidence in national and EU institutions. For instance,severe austerity measures introduced in severalMember States greatly constrained the potential forgovernments to redress the negative social impacts ofthe crisis. \\nHowever, the economic crisis was not the only\\nchallenge national and EU institutions faced. They werealso presented with other societal challenges such asthe consequences of globalisation, increased incomeinequality, and changes in attitudes and values insociety. In western European countries, globalisationand extensive immigration put pressure on the labourmarket position of the lower-middle class. Increasinginequality, in particular the growing incomes of therichest social strata, also deepened the social divide andincreased tensions in many countries (Nolan andWhelan, 2014; Tóth et al, 2014). Changes in societalvalues may also have contributed to the decline in trustin institutions: it is possible that increasingindividualisation resulted in a decline of collectiveengagement among citizens, as well as an increase incritical attitudes towards mainstream politics and‘business-as-usual’. \\nWhile much of the damage to trust in institutions could\\nthus be attributed to the global economic crisis, it isimportant to consider whether there are longer-termtrends or alternative explanations that could helpunderstanding. Key stakeholders want to know how theinstitutional system is performing from the point of viewof citizens, and how trust in this relationship can bebuilt or restored. It is important to examine the extentto which trends in trust are nationally specific and towhat extent there are overarching similarities related tothe social changes that are occurring across countries;for example, changes in values and a decline incollective engagement, or, in contrast, the rise of acritical citizenry whose low trust does not necessarilyinfer disengagement.\\nFindings from research in social and political science\\nindicate that in many countries at various points intime, people in disadvantaged situations (for instance,low income, unemployment or low education,sometimes combined with older age) have had lesstrust in institutions. There is also a growing body ofresearch about quality of governance that highlights theimportance of institutional performance generally aswell as of perceptions of transparency and fairnessmore specifically. One of the major Eurofound findingsin connection with trust in institutions relates to thelarge positive impact that the perceived quality ofpublic services makes on trust in institutions(Eurofound, 2012, further corroborated in this report). \\nIn the current report, Eurofound seeks to broaden the\\nunderstanding of trends in trust in institutions in the EUand their relation to societal changes. The research alsoseeks to characterise the groups in society with greateror lesser trust in institutions and to consider whypatterns of trust have changed over time.\\nDeclining trust in institutions is problematic for several\\nreasons. Although trust in institutions is partly a resultof good institutional performance, it is also an essentialprecondition for good and efficient governance (OECD,2013). Trust in government authorities can improvecompliance with rules and regulations and reduce thecost of enforcement. People will comply with rules ifthey see regulations as fair and legitimate and trust thelegal system and the authorities involved (Jackson et al,2011). Trust increases willingness to pay taxes. Publictrust in the government may also help authorities toimplement structural reforms that have short-termcosts but long-term benefits. In countries characterised\\nIntroduction4as having low trust in institutions, citizens prioritise\\npolitical candidates who promise immediate benefits.This creates opportunities for populist and radicalparties and politicians to rapidly gain popularity bycriticising established policies and promising quick fixesto solve complex problems (Morales, 2017).\\nThis report examines the dynamics of trust in\\ninstitutions since the beginning of the 21st century.After reviewing the literature on trust in institutions inthe next chapter, the key findings of the research arepresented in the following chapter. Firstly, the reportoutlines the trends in trust in institutions in differentMember States as well as in country groups. Theanalysis presents trends in trust at both the nationaland EU levels, including those in relation to specificinstitutions. Secondly, the report studies the differencesbetween social groups in terms of trust dynamics. Thisfocuses on social groups according to demographic andsocioeconomic factors, but also based on factorsrelated to social cohesion (such as perception of socialtensions, social exclusion and political participation) aswell as perceived quality of public services. Afterdescribing the dynamics of trust in institutions amongvarious social groups, multivariate statistical methodsare applied to find potential correlations betweenchanges in trust in institutions considering bothindividual-level and macro-level factors. Finally, thereport presents the findings on the consequences ofchanges in trust in institutions.\\nSocietal change and trust in institutions5This chapter provides an overview of the scholarly\\nliterature on the nature, the roots and policyconsequences of trust in institutions. After clarifying theconcept of trust, the chapter presents the mostimportant findings on trust in institutions, which isgenerally understood to mean confidence in nationalpolitical institutions (such as government orparliament), non-political institutions (such as thepolice and the courts) and other non-state institutions(such as the media). However, trust in the EU has been asubject of growing research interest, in particular sincethe UK’s decision to leave the EU in 2016, commonlyknown as Brexit. This chapter reviews a number ofrecent studies on the origins and dynamics of trust in EUinstitutions.\\nDefinitions of trust\\nTrust is a complex phenomenon, which makes itdifficult to define. According to a generally accepteddefinition, trust is an expectation that the object of trust(for example, a person or an institution) will producepositive outcomes (Levi and Stoker, 2000). Trust orconfidence is therefore viewed as an attitude (thisreport uses the terms ‘trust’ and ‘confidence’interchangeably). \\n[Trust] is a more or less lasting view held about someobject, event or person(s) in the outside world. It is aframe of mind, outlook or perspective whichinfluences one’s behaviour or one’s disposition to actor think in certain ways. The same is true of distrust.Attitudes are not unchangeable, but they are also notmomentary, as feelings may be. Viewed as anattitude, it makes sense to ask questions about trustin opinion polls. \\n(Hosking, 2017)\\nOver the past two decades, the study of trust ininstitutions has received increasing attention, catchingup with the extensive research on social (orinterpersonal) trust that took off in the early 1990s.Social or interpersonal trust concerns trust betweenindividuals, while trust in institutions is defined asconfidence in state organisations (e.g. parliament,government, the police or the courts) or non-stateorganisations (e.g. media, non-governmentalorganisations (NGOs), churches or corporations).The interest in researching trust is driven by anacknowledgement that it is a powerful indicator ofwell-being, both at the individual and the societal level,as well as a fundamental condition of collective actionand cooperation (Kahan, 2001; Tyler, 2011; Eurofound,2013a; OECD, 2013). \\nThe trust of citizens in public institutions is regarded as\\na measure of support for, or legitimacy of, the politicalsphere (Levi and Stoker, 2000). However, the kind ofsupport that trusting attitudes express is an issue ofdebate. Some scholars argue that public trust asmeasured by survey questions means the specificsupport given to the incumbent government, andtherefore bears no relation to the general legitimacy ofthe political system (Citrin, 1974; Citrin and Green,1986). Trust can decrease and then increase again, andeven a long-term decline in public confidence (as hasbeen observed in the US in the past decades) need notnecessarily be a concern because it does not threaten toundermine the legitimacy of democratic polity.\\nHowever, others have found empirical evidence that\\ntrust is related to both specific and diffuse support(Miller, 1974; Miller and Listhaug, 1990). The notions ofspecific and diffuse support were developed by DavidEaston (Easton, 1965). Diffuse support is the acceptanceor general legitimacy of a system as such, while specificsupport relates to the incumbent and individual-levelsatisfaction with the performance of the government.The general support for a system might be high even ifpeople are dissatisfied with governmental performanceor leading politicians lose their legitimacy, for instance,because of political scandals. Conversely, the systemmight be illegitimate, while some politicians or publicinstitutions may enjoy widespread popularity andsupport. Easton himself associated public trust with thenotion of diffuse support, although he alsoacknowledged that elements of specific and diffusesupport are difficult to discern in practice (Easton,1975). However, using empirically based arguments,Hetherington (1998) argues that trust actually affectsboth specific and diffuse support. Trust has been shownto be a dynamic phenomenon (Hetherington, 2005), sothere is a risk that a vicious circle may develop in whichlow trust and poor governmental performance mutuallyreinforce each other, leading to overall dissatisfactionwith the political system.1Policy context and literature\\nreview   6The above considerations illustrate the point that trust\\nin institutions should be regarded as a phenomenonthat is\\n£ complex\\n£ differentiated\\n£ context-dependent\\n£ dynamic \\nThis is also the approach endorsed by the presentreport.\\nComplexity of the phenomenon\\nTrust is a complex phenomenon: hence, it is difficult todefine precisely what the display of trust in institutionsmay be expressing. Trust is linked to expectations aboutthe future – that a given actor (institution, person etc.)will produce positive outcomes (Levi and Stoker, 2000).However, trust depends on a number of factors:\\n£ rational (for example, based on previousexperience)\\n£ emotional (rooted in the character of the trustingperson or the appealing features of the person orentity who is trusted, etc.) \\n£ moral (for example, evaluating the fairness of thesituation)\\n£ individual (stemming from the given person’ssocialisation or community membership, etc.)\\n£ macro-level (involving the pervasiveness of normcompliance in a society)\\nTrust attitudes may reflect satisfaction, optimism,legitimacy perceptions, and so on. For more on thefactors affecting trust, see Campbell (2004), Tyler(2006b), Levi et al (2009), Marien and Hooghe (2011),Newton and Zmerli (2011), Eurofound (2013b), Medve-Bálint and Boda (2014) and Becker et al (2016).\\nThe complexity of the phenomenon has a number of\\nimplications. First, while in general it is assumed that agreater level of trust is preferable, this is not necessarilythe case in all situations, just as low trust is not always aconcern. A high level of trust in institutions may implyuncritical attitudes towards politics and even reducethe political interest and activity of citizens, while adiminishing level of trust may be a warning signal oferoding legitimacy (Butler et al, 2016). Second, given thecomplexity inherent in trust attitudes and the tendencyfor trust to create positive feedback loops, establishingcausal relationships between trust and other factors isespecially challenging. Regardless of the difficulty indistinguishing causes and effects, there is evidence ofpositive association between trust in institutions andother measures of institutional quality, as well asquality of life. In this context, quality of life includes thequality of public services, the quality of democracy,control of corruption, income, satisfaction with life,and income equality. These correlations present a goodreason for policy actors to take account ofdevelopments in trust in society.\\nDifferentiation of trust relations\\nGiven the complexity of the phenomenon of trust, it isadvisable to differentiate among specific trust relations.Aggregated trust indicators and average values mayhide meaningful differences among the trustingattitudes of social groups whose compositional logicextends beyond the usual demographic variables(like age, gender or education level) as well asconfidence in different institutions with differentsociopolitical functions. Some institutions, like thegovernment, are held responsible for the challengesfaced by society, while others, like the courts, arejudged more in the light of normative values(Grosskopf, 2008). Trust in some institutions may bemore politicised and express general legitimacyattitudes, while confidence in other institutions maystem from personal experience and be moreoutcome-oriented. These differences may havepractical policy implications when it comes to measuresfor increasing trust. Trust research so far has focusedmainly on a few institutions, for instance, politicalinstitutions, courts and police, and tax authorities(see Chanley et al, 2000; Murphy, 2004; Rudolph, 2009;Hawdon, 2008; Jackson et al, 2011; Győrffy, 2012), butthere is still a lack of systematic comparisons betweendifferent types of institutions. Similarly, little attentionhas been devoted so far to examining the different trustpatterns of specific social groups.\\nImportance of context dependency\\nAs implied in the previous section, trust in institutions ishighly context dependent. Patterns of trust vary acrossdifferent social, institutional, political or culturalcontexts. This fact has been acknowledged in theliterature (see Zmerli and Hooghe, 2011); however, adeeper understanding could and should be developedin this respect. As Bradford et al (2014) note (specificallyconcerning trust in police), most existing researchapplies to a limited context because the bulk ofscholarly work has been conducted in Anglo-Saxon andwestern European countries. This observation is alsotrue on a more general scale, and is therefore applicableto other fields of research on trust in institutions. Forinstance, there is surprisingly little literature providingcomparisons of the patterns of trust in institutions ofthe newer democracies of eastern and central Europe tothose of older Member States, especially in terms ofmore recent developments.\\nDynamic nature of trust \\nThe complexity and context dependence of trust ininstitutions makes it a dynamic phenomenon. Again,although this has been acknowledged in the literature(see Hetherington, 2005), most researchers still conductSocietal change and trust in institutions7cross-sectional analyses without making comparisons\\nover time, even though it has been demonstrated thattrust dynamics may differ significantly depending onthe context (Boda and Medve-Bálint, 2014). Within theobvious limitations of the data that are available, thisreport focuses on the dynamics of trust indicators.\\nTrust in national institutions\\nThis section reviews the literature on trust ininstitutions. It gives an account of the factors affectingtrust at both the macro and the micro levels, includingperceptions of the characteristics of institutionaloperation. It then provides a short overview of thepossible practical consequences of trust in institutions.Following the organisation of the scholarly literature,this section then focuses on national institutions. Trustin the EU is covered in the next section, ‘Trust in EUinstitutions’ (p. 9).\\nTrust at the macro level\\nTrust is determined by a number of factors, both  macroand micro-level. At the macro level, income (GDP) isconsidered to be a strong predictor, at least in Europe,with high-income countries usually having higher publicconfidence in institutions (Delhey and Newton, 2005;Anderson and Singer, 2008; Medve-Bálint and Boda,2014). However, after conducting a multilevel analysison the data of 65 countries, Wang and Gordon (2011)found no statistically significant association betweennational income and the level of trust in institutions.A possible explanation is that, from a globalperspective, the European development model is apeculiar one in which different dimensions of socialwell-being (including trust), institutional quality andmaterial welfare are all positively associated with eachother.\\nIt is particularly interesting that, against the\\nbackground of economic crisis and growing inequality(OECD, 2015), there are surprisingly few studies onincome inequality and trust in institutions. Severalstudies have however revealed a negative associationbetween income inequality and social (interpersonal)trust (Uslaner, 2000; Wang and Gordon, 2011). Given thestrong association between interpersonal trust andinstitutional confidence, one would assume a similarpattern between income inequality and trust ininstitutions. Indeed, the multilevel study of inequalityand trust in institutions conducted by Anderson andSinger (2008), using a sample of 20 European countries,found that higher income inequality was associatedwith lower trust in institutions. However, while incomeinequality generally has a negative effect on trust,countries in central and eastern Europe seem to be anexception to this. In these countries, trust in institutionsis not associated with inequality (Medve-Bálint andBoda, 2014); instead, relatively low trust levels co-existwith relatively low income inequality. The explanationfor this might lie in the characteristics of the politicalculture and people’s attitudes: in the central andeastern European countries, people generallyoverestimate the level of income inequality and expresshigh expectations for government involvement insolving social problems (Medve-Bálint and Boda, 2014).\\nTrust in institutions is also influenced by the general\\nculture of trust of the given society. Fukuyama (1995)argued that societies can be characterised either ashigh-trust or low-trust cultures, and that this feature issomehow rooted in history. Approaches that emphasisethe role of political culture argue that ‘institutional trustis exogenous to the political sphere, originating inlong-standing and deeply seeded cultural norms and isan emergent property of interpersonal trust which isprojected onto political institutions’ (Campbell, 2004,p. 402). These approaches hold that trust in institutionsis part of a larger belief system that influences how andhow much people trust each other and impersonalorganisations. To put it simply, the level of trust ininstitutions is greater in societies where, because ofspecific historical and cultural factors, general socialtrust is greater (Kunioka and Woller, 1999). Indeed,Keele (2007) found that there is a remarkably strongassociation between interpersonal trust and trust ininstitutions at the country level – this strong associationsuggests that a common cultural background variablemay determine both. However, the greater volatility oftrust in institutions compared to interpersonalconfidence suggests that the former is influenced byfactors outside the general cultural background; forinstance, by perceptions of institutional performance(Boda and Medve-Bálint, 2014).\\nTrust at the individual level\\nTrust can be influenced by individual-level factors:generally speaking, wealthier, more educated, morereligious and more optimistic people tend to havegreater trust in institutions (Newton and Zmerli, 2011;Boda and  Medve-Bálint, 2014).\\nHowever, the results of different studies are not\\nconclusive in terms of individual-level determinants.The role of personal income has received particularattention, with contradictory results. For instance,Kaasa and Parts (2008) analysed trust in 31 Europeancountries, relying on data from the World Values Survey(WVS, 1999–2002) and found that income,operationalised as household income decile, did nothave a significant relationship with trust in institutions.However, Catterberg and Moreno (2006) found thatwell-being, defined as financial satisfaction andsatisfaction with one’s life, was positively andsignificantly associated with trust in institutions in theirsample of 26 countries. Catterberg and Moreno alsoincluded an income variable into their model, and theresults suggested that higher individual incomedecreased trust in established democracies, while itboosted trust in eastern Europe and in Latin America.Policy context and literature review8These results contradict the findings of Kaasa and Parts\\n(2008), even though both pieces of research relied onthe same WVS datasets. \\nFrom an analysis of patterns of trust in institutions in\\n10 central and eastern European countries, Mishlerand Rose (2001) found that individual-level incomehad virtually no effect on trust in institutions.However, using data from the European Social Survey,Medve-Bálint and Boda (2014) reported that themarginal effect of household income is positive inwestern European countries but negative in central andeastern Europe. The positive association between trustand income implies that the ‘winner hypothesis’ holds(that is, successful people have more trust ininstitutions). On the other hand, the lack of thisphenomenon in east central Europe suggests theplausibility of a ‘dependency hypothesis’, whereeconomically disadvantaged citizens who depend onthe state’s welfare services trust institutions more, or a‘frustration hypothesis’, where economicallyadvantaged citizens are dissatisfied with theinstitutional performance of their country.\\nAt the individual level, at least one more consideration\\nmerits attention. Research has highlighted theimportance of collective identity in promoting trust andcooperative behaviour (Kramer et al, 2001; Tyler, 2011).That is, identification with a group or a supra-individualentity (like the nation state) increases both trusting andcooperative attitudes. For instance, after studying theroots of tax compliance, Bartha and Boda (2016) foundthat, in Hungary, beyond any other sociodemographicor attitudinal variables, the strongest predictor of bothtrust in the tax authority and voluntary tax complianceis the degree of identification with the nation (measuredthrough agreement with the statement ‘I am proud tobe Hungarian’).\\nTrust as a function of institutional\\noperation \\nAn important body of literature argues that trust in\\ninstitutions is largely shaped by perceptions of thefairness and the (outcome-based) performance of thoseinstitutions (Murtin et al, 2018). This has importantpolicy implications: increasing trust and legitimacyrequires improving normative rightness as well as theperformance of state institutions.\\nOne important question concerns the relative\\nimportance of fairness and outcome-basedperformance in shaping trust and the extent to whichthis interaction is affected by contextual variables. Itcomes as no surprise that people need to believe thatinstitutions are effective (e.g. that the police and courtsare professional and able to fulfil their roles) in order totrust them (see Jackson et al, 2011; Tyler, 2011).However, many studies argue that normativeconsiderations are just as, or even more, important thaninstrumental ones in shaping trust in institutions. Thishas been demonstrated in the case of a number ofdifferent institutional settings: government (Levi et al,2009), the law (Tyler, 1990; Jackson et al, 2011), thepolice (Tyler, 2006b; Hawdon, 2008), tax authorities(Murphy, 2004) and municipalities (Tyler, 2011). Byanalysing European data, Grönlund and Setälä alsoshowed that trust in institutions at the individual leveldepends both on interpersonal trust and on certainnormative expectations posed towards thoseinstitutions: ‘the more people trust other people andthe more honest they find the civil servants of theircountry, the more they trust public institutions’(Grönlund and Setälä, 2012, p. 538).\\nAmong the normative concerns considered in the\\nliterature, the role of procedural fairness has beenparticularly emphasised. In his ground-breaking study,Tyler (1990) argued that procedural fairness is the mainroot of both trust and compliance behaviour. Murphy(2004) found that in Australia, tax evasion was linked tothe perceived unfairness of the tax authority. Thisexplains why, seemingly paradoxically, imposing strictsanctions did not have a positive effect on willingness topay tax. Instead, these measures triggered further taxevasion. Similarly, Gangl (2003) argues that people’sperceptions of the legitimacy of the US Congress aremore influenced by considerations of proceduralfairness concerning its functioning than by anydistributive effects (outcomes) of decisions. Accordingto Tyler (2011), procedural fairness may refer to normsof both decision-making (for instance, lack of bias,transparency, stakeholder inclusion, participation) andtreatment (respect, benevolence, reliability). In otherwords, people trust an institution based on theirperceptions of how it treats them and whether it makesfair decisions. Consequently, perceptions of corruption,discrimination and undemocratic functioning are likelyto decrease confidence. \\nPractical consequences of trust\\nTrust is important because it is a powerful indicator ofquality of life and social well-being (Eurofound, 2013b).However, it is also important because it is believed tofoster economic development as well as the efficiencyof governance through three basic mechanisms:stabilising social interactions; providing support fordifficult political decisions; and helping with theimplementation of policies and the effective operationof state institutions.\\nSince trust essentially involves expectations concerning\\nthe future, it stabilises social interactions as it lowerstransaction costs and increases predictability. Theexistence of stable, reliable and trustworthy stateinstitutions are an important condition of thedevelopment of the private sector (Brunetti et al, 1997;Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012).Societal change and trust in institutions9Also, trust in institutions is believed to be a measure of\\nthe support citizens give to the government, andsupport is a precious resource for the effective use ofpower (Easton, 1965). The lack of trust may signallegitimacy problems and make it difficult for thegovernment to initiate long-term (albeit much-neededor beneficial) policies. Unfortunately, there are fewpractical studies around this subject. Győrffy (2012)demonstrated that trust in institutions was a key factorin successful fiscal adjustment programmes acrossEurope, as in high-trust countries citizens believed inand accepted the necessity of austerity measures. In theUS, Hetherington (2005) showed that trust in thegovernment is the strongest predictor of passing‘liberal’ (that is, welfare) policies, irrespective of thepolitical leaning of the government. Welfare policies arepolitically risky in the US context and greater trustprovides the necessary support for policy action. Ofcourse, it is not true that all risky or painful decisionsare necessarily beneficial in the long run; therefore, thetrust of citizens can also be abused by decision-makers.However, given the dynamic nature of trust, one wouldexpect public confidence to fall in such a case. \\nFinally, it is also believed that trust in institutions makes\\ngovernance more efficient and policy implementationeasier, as people who have confidence in institutionsare more willing to comply with state authorities andthe law, pay taxes and generally take part in collectiveaction (Tyler, 2006b; Tyler, 2011; OECD, 2013). Trustreduces the transaction costs of governmentaloperations and therefore makes the functioning ofpublic administration more efficient (Van de Walle,2017). Research shows that the legitimacy of, and trustin, the legal system are the strongest predictors of thewillingness of people to obey the law and to cooperatewith authorities across countries (Jackson et al, 2014).Citizens who are not trusting, on the other hand, aremore likely to calculate the costs and benefits ofcompliance, and this might lead to freeriding practices(Tyler, 2006b). Using data from the 1998 InternationalSocial Survey Programme, Dalton (2004) found a strongpositive association between variables measuring thedegree of disagreement with misreporting income inorder to avoid tax and falsely claim government benefitson the one hand and trust in parliament and in thecourts on the other. However, both trust measurementsproved to be strongly related to upholding norms withregard to taxes and social benefits. Other studies alsofound that trust in the government and trust in the taxauthority predicts voluntary tax compliance attitudes(Murphy, 2004; Bird et al, 2008).\\nThe erosion of trust may also have political\\nconsequences. Morales (2017) argues that there is apositive association between trust in politicalinstitutions and voting behaviour, implying that erodingtrust may lead to political disengagement and cynicism.A similar pattern is observable concerning partymembership. In contrast, the association betweenconfidence in political institutions and protestbehaviour is much weaker, and sometimes thisrelationship is even marginally positive (that is, thosewho express confidence are more likely to protest),sometimes not significant (levels of political confidenceare unrelated to protest behaviour) and sometimesnegative (those who express less confidence are morelikely to protest). The nature of this relationship variesacross countries and over time. Finally, there are someindications that decreasing trust may lead to growingsupport for populist and radical parties (Morales, 2017).\\nTrust in EU institutions\\nThe extent of trust in EU institutions is of as muchinterest as trust in national ones, especially in the wakeof the result of the UK referendum supporting thecountry’s exit from the EU. It is particularly informativeto review trust in the EU in comparison with trust innational institutions. When trust in the EU iscomparatively lower, this might signal the growth orspread of anti-EU sentiment. The close relationshipbetween the two might reveal the potential of spill-overeffects from one to the other: for example, if distrust innational institutions decreases trust in EU institutions.This might reflect a tendency among citizens not to beable to distinguish clearly between one and the other.\\nThe crisis provides an interesting example of changes in\\nEuropean citizens’ perceptions of EU institutions. Rothet al (2013) analysed the effects of the crisis on trust innational and EU institutions at the beginning of thecrisis (within an EU27 country sample during the period1999 to 2012). Results showed that the overall negativetrend of declining trust was mostly accounted for by thedecrease in trust in countries in the euro zone – inparticular, in Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain.Econometric analysis revealed that the significantincrease in unemployment rates in those four countries,especially in Spain, largely contributed to thispronounced fall in trust. Papaioannou (2013) alsoconfirmed that attitudes towards European institutionshave deteriorated in crisis-hit countries, but highlightedthat this effect was less pronounced than the fall in trustin local political parties and politicians.\\nFactors affecting trust and distrust \\nIndividual factors\\nVarious studies have focused on the origins of trust inthe EU, testing theories about the role of identificationwith Europe, national political culture, education levelsand media consumption (Gabel and Whitten, 1997;Gabel, 1998; Hooghe, 2007; Arnold et al, 2012). Identityand emotional attachment to Europe indeed seem toplay a role for instance, Manzi et al (2016) argue thatthere is an attachment to the EU, even in countries withincreasing unemployment and poor living standards.Policy context and literature review10People tend to care about the EU’s democratic\\nprocedures and institutions; however, their perceivedimportance has changed over time due to increasedpublic awareness of the consequences of the EUintegration process (Torcal et al, 2012). The growth inhigher education in itself might lead to more awarenessof the shortcomings of EU institutions and make citizensmore hesitant, or even unwilling, to trust them (Arnoldet al, 2012). As citizens learn more, they may alsobecome more critical and set higher standards for theirrepresentatives. This suggests that as more powers aretransferred to the EU level, people may become morecritical and demanding of EU institutions (Hobolt, 2012).In addition, those with high levels of political knowledgerely more heavily on evaluations of EU institutions whenassessing democracy in the EU (Karp et al, 2003).\\nA recent study (Conti and Memoli, 2017) highlighted the\\nrole of the media in trust towards the EU. Those who aremost exposed to traditional media are more favourablydisposed towards the EU process and are more likely totrust EU institutions.\\nOn the other hand, the more divided the national\\nleaders are, the more people are prone to opposeEuropean integration, and this effect is particularlypronounced among people who see themselves asexclusively national citizens (Hooghe and Marks, 2005).\\nMacro-level conditions\\nTrust in the European Commission and the EuropeanParliament seems to be strongly associated with thesituation in the real economy (unemployment andgrowth of GDP per capita), but only in times of crisis(Roth et al, 2011). Similarly, Gomez (2015) showed thatsupport for the EU is indeed correlated withmacroeconomic conditions after the crisis, which isunsurprising given the unpopularity of EU-backedausterity measures in many crisis-hit countries.\\nIncome inequality negatively affects trust in the\\nEuropean Commission and the European Parliament innormal times, while in times of crisis this relationship isstrengthened and extended to the European CentralBank (ECB). In addition, inflation and unemploymentseem to have considerably affected trust in allEuropean institutions in a negative way after the crisis(Bonasia et al, 2016). \\nInstitutional performance: European and national\\nHarteveld et al (2013), as well as Armingeon and Ceka(2014), argue that attitudes towards the EU are primarilyderived from public opinion about national-levelpolitics and policy: that is, the institutional performanceof the EU has little, if any, effect on public confidence.However, others argue that public trust in the EU isresponsive to the performance of European institutions,and the existence of trust (or mistrust) in ‘distant’institutions suggests that people are not indifferent towhat happens in supranational institutions (Hudson,2006).\\nDifferent explanations for the decline of trust in the EU\\nare provided by studies on the consequences of theeconomic crisis (see for instance, Kumlin, 2009;Armingeon and Ceka, 2014). The loss of trust in the EUafter 2008 was explained both by poor economicperformance and by the quality of governance(via subjective assessments of how governments dealtwith corruption) according to Mungiu-Pippidi et al(2015). Numerous studies further argue that support forEuropean integration derives from the ability ofEU institutions to deliver economic benefits, either forindividual households or for the nation as a whole(Gabel, 1998; Christin, 2005; Gomez, 2015). \\nPeople from countries with relatively extensive welfare\\nstates are more likely to trust the EU institutions,possibly because of an already developed confidencethat institutional bodies will provide them withsatisfactory services (Arnold et al, 2012). Furthermore,according to Freitag and Bühlmann (2009), people livingin countries where authorities are seen as incorruptible,where the institutions of the welfare state reduceincome disparities, and where political interests arerepresented in a manner proportional to their weightare more likely to have higher levels of trust.\\nOn the other hand, dissatisfaction with national public\\nservices seems to have direct negative effects on trust inthe EU in most of the EU15 countries. The effect isstronger in larger welfare states where the limitationson welfare policies are perceived as stemming from theEU and where the most euro-sceptic parties are themost likely to support the welfare state (Kumlin, 2009).\\nAcross Europe, the public evaluates institutions not only\\nin terms of efficiency, but also in terms of integrity(Eurofound, 2012). Corruption erodes trust in thenational political system, lowers the perceived costs ofceding sovereignty to supranational bodies, andincreases citizens’ willingness to turn to the EU foralternatives (Sánchez-Cuenca, 2000; Arnold et al, 2012).Moreover, people living in Member States with a higherlevel of national corruption seem to have more trust ininternational institutions, such as the EU. However, thisrelationship appears to have dissipated after 2008(Obydenkova and Arpino, 2017). Despite this narrowinggap, trust in national institutions remains lower thantrust in the EU (EPRS, 2016). This is confirmed in thecase of Romania where euro-enthusiasm has national,rather than European, roots (Radu, 2016). By contrast,living in a country with highly trusted andwell-performing institutions appears to reduce trust inthe European Parliament (Muñoz et al, 2011). In otherwords, national proxies seem to play a leading role inshaping EU-related opinions and attitudes.Societal change and trust in institutions11In light of the empirical findings, several authors have\\nput forward policy proposals to suggest how toimprove public confidence in the EU. According toMungiu-Pippidi et al (2015), since the current crisis intrust was, to a certain extent, brought about by thecontrast between the harsh austerity measures laidupon citizens and the self-serving behaviour andflouting of rules indulged in by politicians, a change inthe behaviour of EU politicians would help restore trust.Hobolt (2012) argues that as people attribute morepower to the EU level and become more knowledgeableabout how it operates, they become more demanding ofthe quality of democratic institutions beyond the nationstate. Introducing a sense of public ownership istherefore essential, irrespective of the level and locationof decision-making.Papaioannou (2016) argues the need for institutionalreform at the EU level and institutional convergencetowards best practices. He proposes the establishmentof a European‐ level body to monitor institutional\\nperformance and state capacity across the EU and theeuro zone. To tackle the rise of populism and restoreconfidence in the EU, Algan et al (2017) further proposethe implementation of countercyclical macroeconomicpolicies to prevent high levels of unemployment and topreserve the trust of people facing economic insecurityby providing better social security nets for theunemployed. \\nSome argue that improvements in the economic\\nsituation alone would not necessarily restore supportfor the European project. The EU needs to deliver globalpublic goods and provide security, while respecting thenational identities of EU citizens (Dustmann et al, 2017).\\nPolicy context and literature review13Patterns of trust dynamics\\nLong-term trends in trust \\nThe assessment of longer-term trends of trust in\\ninstitutions during the 21st century is based on datafrom the Eurobarometer study. This study usesdichotomous questions to measure trust (where 1means ‘tend to trust’ and 0 means ‘tend not to trust’),therefore trust in a given country at a given time can becharacterised by the percentage of respondents whotend to trust the specific institution. Unfortunately, notall items are present in every wave of the study, whichmakes it difficult to construct a consistent series ofcomposite indicators of different types of trust. Thus,instead of building composite indicators, the evolutionof trust is described here in terms of trust in selectednational institutions (government, police, the press) andthe EU. \\nAs Figures 1 and 2 show, there are important differences\\nin trends of trust in institutions between the regions ofEurope, but variation can also be found betweencountries in the same region. In general, the northernEuropean Member States are characterised by relativelyhigh levels of trust in their national governments andtrust in the EU. While trust in national governmentsdeclined during the crisis years in Denmark andincreased after 2014, in the case of Finland and Swedenonly smaller fluctuations occurred during the sameperiod. In the case of Sweden and Denmark there is alsoa sub-period where trust in the EU declined, but bothcountries had greater trust in the EU in 2017 than in2001.\\nThere are also differences in the patterns of change in\\nnational trust in institutions among countries in westernEurope. Trust in the national governments and the EUseems to be slightly declining in Austria, Belgium andFrance, although in the case of France there was somerecovery of trust in government at the end of the period.The most significant decline in trust in government andthe EU can be seen in Ireland, which was probably thecountry hit most hard by the crisis in this region.Although there was a notable recovery at the end of theperiod, trust levels did not return to their pre-crisislevels. In the cases of Germany, Luxembourg, theNetherlands and the UK, trust in the government and inthe EU fluctuates during this period, but levels weresimilar at the beginning and the end of the period.\\nMost of the countries in Figure 2 had greater trust in the\\nEU than the national government (with the exception ofCyprus) throughout the period. In southern Europeancountries such as Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain, whichwere severely hit by the economic crisis, a clear declinein trust in the national government and the EU can bedetected. In Portugal, there was some recovery of trustlevels by the end of the period, although trust in the EUwas still lower in 2017 than at the beginning of theperiod. \\nAmong the eastern European countries, only Slovenia\\nshowed a decline in both trust in the EU and in thegovernment during the period. In the Visegrad countries(the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia), aswell as Bulgaria and Romania, trust in the EU declinedover the period, while trust in the national governmentfluctuated or slightly increased, as is the case of Poland.As a result, trust in the EU and trust in the nationalgovernment have converged. In the Baltic countries,trust in both the EU and the government broadlystagnated, while in Croatia trust in the EU increased.\\nOverall, these results suggest that there is no uniform\\ntrend of declining trust in national institutions in EUcountries. Many countries saw declining trust in politicalinstitutions (national government or the EU) during theyears of the economic crisis. However, even duringthese years there were countries where political trustdid not decline, for instance, Poland. On the other hand,before and after the crisis years political trust evenincreased in several countries.\\nTrust in non-political state institutions (such as the\\npolice) did not closely follow the trends of political trustand did not fall during the crisis years. Trust in the pressalso showed less volatility over the same period thantrust in national governments. Comparing the first andlast observation of the period under analysis, trust innational government was lower in 2017 than in 2001 inroughly half of EU28 countries (15 out of 28). The sameis true for 13 countries in the case of the press, but onlyin five countries for trust in police. On the other hand,trust in the EU declined in a majority of countries (20 outof 28), and only a minority of eight countries saw eitherno further decline or an increase of trust in the EU overthe period. \\nThese longer-term trends in trust in institutions also\\nshed light on the volatility of trust. The business cycleand political changes affect changes, especially in trustin political institutions. For instance, the sudden rise oftrust in the government in Portugal in recent years, orthe rise in trust in institutions in Hungary around 2010was linked to the election of a new government. Theunpredictability and variation in the case of specificinstitutions is one of the arguments in favour of\\n2Key findings on trust in\\ninstitutions   14monitoring a range of institutions, as has been\\nundertaken by the European Quality of Life Survey(EQLS).\\nMapping changes in trust in national\\ninstitutions\\nThis section takes a different perspective on changes in\\ntrust in institutions using the EQLS. Here, trust ininstitutions is measured on a 10-point scale(where 1 means ‘do not trust at all’ and 10 means‘trust completely’), which allows the finer measurementof trust attitudes. This is important as this finermeasurement scale makes the construction ofcomposite indicators easier and allows for theinvestigation of tendencies to polarisation.Despite differences in the measurement scales for trustvariables and other methodological details of theEurobarometer and the EQLS, survey results regardingthe direction of changes in trust in institutions aresimilar, especially in the case of the crisis period(see in the separate technical report publishedalongside this report – Societal change and trust ininstitutions: Analysis of results). In the case of trust innational government, both surveys show declining trustbetween 2007 and 2011 in most countries. For theperiod between 2011 and 2016, the number of countrieswith increasing and declining trust is roughly equalbased on the Eurobarometer, while the EQLS suggeststhat trust in institutions has increased in a majority ofcountries.Societal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 1: Long-term trends for trust in national government and in EU institutions – northern and western\\nMember States (%)\\nNote: Trust in institutions is measured with a dichotomous item where 1 = ‘tend to trust’ and 0 = ‘tend not to trust’. \\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Eurobarometer 2001–2017 01020304050607080Denmark\\n01020304050607080Finland\\n01020304050607080Sweden\\n01020304050607080Austria\\n01020304050607080Belgium\\n01020304050607080Germany\\n01020304050607080France\\n01020304050607080Ireland\\n01020304050607080Luxembourg\\n01020304050607080Netherlands\\n01020304050607080United Kingdom\\nTrust in the EU Trust in national government15Key findings on trust in institutions\\nFigure 2: Long-term trends for trust in national government and in EU institutions – eastern, central and\\nsouthern Member States (%)\\n01020304050607080Estonia\\n01020304050607080Latvia\\n01020304050607080Lithuania\\n01020304050607080Poland\\n01020304050607080Czech Republic\\n01020304050607080Slovakia\\n01020304050607080Hungary\\n01020304050607080Slovenia\\n01020304050607080Croatia\\n01020304050607080Portugal\\n01020304050607080Spain\\n01020304050607080Italy\\n01020304050607080Malta\\n01020304050607080Cyprus\\n01020304050607080Greece\\n01020304050607080Bulgaria\\n01020304050607080Romania\\nNote: Trust in institutions is measured with a dichotomous item, where 1 = ‘tend to trust’ and 0 = ‘tend not to trust’. \\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Eurobarometer 2001–2017 Trust in the EU Trust in national government16One measure of overall trust in institutions is based on\\nthe five items that are present in the second, third andfourth waves of the EQLS (hereafter termed EQLS 2007,EQLS 2011 and EQLS 2016): namely, trust in the nationalparliament, trust in the national government, trust inthe legal system, trust in the police and trust in the news(media). Respondents’ overall trust in nationalinstitutions is characterised by averaging responses tothese questions.

Source: Authors’ calculations based on EQLS.  \\n1 Internal consistency of the overall trust measure has been assessed by Cronbach α- statistic (see in the separate technical report). The value of this\\nstatistic is close to or higher than 0.80 in all countries in all waves of the survey. The only exception is Denmark in 2011, but the Cronbach α is higher than0.70 in this case as well. A reliability coefficient of 0.70 or higher is considered acceptable in most social science research situations.17Overall trust in institutions was lowest in 2007 in\\nBulgaria, Croatia and Latvia, where the average trustrating was below 4. Values between 4 and 4.5 were alsofound in other central and eastern European countriesas well as in Italy. The highest levels of trust ininstitutions were in the northern European countriesDenmark and Finland, where the overall score was closeto 7. Values over 6 were also found in Austria, theNetherlands and Sweden. The Member States withmid-level trust in institutions included westernEuropean countries and the southern Europeancountries, together with Estonia. Between 2007 and2011, trust in institutions declined in most EU MemberStates. Countries heavily affected by the economicdownturn – such as Greece and Spain – showed thebiggest decline in trust in institutions, but Romania,Slovakia and Cyprus also saw a significant decline intrust. Although trust in institutions declined at all levels,countries with relatively low levels of trust at thebeginning saw the greatest fall in trust. In several othercountries trust either increased or did not change –Germany, Luxembourg, the UK, Bulgaria, Croatia, andSweden.The most recent data suggest that the decline in trust ininstitutions during the crisis years was a temporaryphenomenon, as between 2011 and 2016 trust ininstitutions increased in most EU countries. The biggestincreases were seen in Lithuania, Hungary andRomania, where the trust score increased by more thanone point. Trust in institutions also grew substantially inPortugal, Latvia and Greece. Again, the greatest changeswere seen among countries with relatively low levels oftrust in institutions in 2011, which means that thesecountries were able to close the gap with countriescharacterised by higher trust levels. Trust levelsremained unchanged in Denmark, France and Spain. \\nAs shown by Figure 4, during the entire period from 2007\\nto 2016, seven countries recorded a statisticallysignificant decline in trust in institutions. The mostsignificant decline in trust was recorded in Spain, withconfidence decreasing considerably during the crisisyears and no improvement reported in the subsequentperiod. Trust in institutions also saw a major decline inGreece over the entire period, despite the significantimprovement between 2011 and 2016.

Trustin some institutions may be more politicised andexpress an attitude of general legitimacy, while in othercases, trust in institutions may stem from personalexperience and be more outcome-oriented.

Despite this, this report considers these items as a separate category as principal component analysisreveals that these items are different from the two items related to political institutions.Figure 6: Trust in national non-political institutions, 2007, 2011 and 2016  \\n1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0BulgariaCroatiaSlovakiaSloveniaCyprusPolandRomaniaSpainGreeceLatviaItalyPortugalCzech RepublicFranceMaltaBelgiumHungaryLithuaniaIrelandUKEstoniaNetherlandsSwedenGermanyLuxembourgAustriaFinlandDenmark\\n2007 2011 2016\\nNotes: Countries are sorted according to data in 2016.

Even countries with high levels of political trustsuch as Denmark and Finland saw declining trust in thisperiod. On the other hand, some countries – Sweden,Luxembourg, Germany, the UK, Hungary, Poland, andBulgaria saw no decline or only a minimal decline intrust in political institutions during the crisis years.During the period 2011–2016, trust in politicalinstitutions increased, although the increase was moremoderate than the decline in the previous period.\\nAs Figure 6 shows, trust in the legal system and the\\npolice is somewhat greater in EU countries than trust inpolitical institutions, and changes in trust were moremoderate for these institutions. During the crisis years(2007–2011), the fall in trust in non-political stateinstitutions was smaller than the fall in trust in politicalinstitutions, but during the second sub-period(2011–2016) the rise in trust was also more moderate.Figure 7 indicates that  trust in the media has also beenless volatile than trust in political institutions.\\nChanges in trust – EU institutions\\nTrust in EU institutions, measured for the EU as a whole,had a declining trend from 2007 to 2011, somestabilisation between 2011 and 2015 and a slightSocietal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 7: Trust in the media, 2007, 2011 and 2016 \\n1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0GreeceSloveniaCroatiaUKFranceCyprusHungarySpainSlovakiaPolandCzech RepublicBulgariaIrelandAustriaItalyMaltaDenmarkBelgiumPortugalLatviaGermanyLithuaniaEstoniaRomaniaLuxembourgSwedenNetherlandsFinland\\n2007 2011 2016\\nNotes: Countries are sorted according to data in 2016.

In particular,\\ntrust in the EU started declining after the onset of theeconomic crisis and reached its lowest level in 2012when less than a third of EU citizens surveyed reportedthat they had trust in the EU. After a period when itremained stable, it started increasing again. At thebeginning of 2017, nearly 42% of EU citizens reportedhaving confidence in the EU. Part of this late recoverymay be related to the difference in the sequence ofquestions in the last survey compared with the previousStandard Eurobarometer. This may have putrespondents in a more positive frame of mind whenanswering (European Commission, 2017a). Moreover,the proportion of non-responses was higher in 2004 and2007 than in 2011 and 2016 in the EU as a whole, whichmay reflect greater indecision among EU citizens beforethe crisis started (for details on the treatment of ‘don’tknow’ answers, see separate technical report\\n3).\\nThis suggests that EU citizens adopted a more definitepoint of view on the EU as a result of the economiccrisis, particularly in a number of countries where theproportion of non-responses declined sharply,for instance, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Ireland,Spain, Italy, Austria and the UK. On the other hand,indecision seemed to increase (that is, the proportionof non-responses went up) between 2007 and 2016 in afew countries, for instance, Denmark, Estonia and Malta.The level of trust is not the same for all EU institutions,though it tends to change over time in a similar way totrust in the EU overall. Citizens tend to have more trustin the European Parliament (even if trust in thisinstitution has declined since 2004) than, for instance, inthe European Commission or in the ECB.\\n4Between 2004\\nand 2017, the proportion of EU citizens who had trust inthe European Parliament fell by 12 percentage points,from just over 56% to slightly under 44%, while trust inthe European Commission fell from 50% to 41% overthe same period of time. For both institutions, thesharpest reduction was in crisis-hit countries; this willbe elaborated in a later section.\\nTrust in the ECB declined by even more over this period,\\nfrom 53% of people expressing trust at the beginning of2007 to 37% at the beginning of 2017 with a low of 31%in mid-2014. This reduction is noted in the literature.Trust in the ECB was scarcely affected by business cyclevariables such as growth and inflation before 2008, butwith the recession, a closer correlation betweenvariations in country economic indicators (such as GDPgrowth, inflation and unemployment rate) and trust inthe ECB developed (Gros and Roth, 2010). However, therecovery which began in mid-2009 was not able torestore trust in the ECB to previous levels. This findingseems to imply that EU citizens put a significant share ofthe blame for the economic downturn on the ECBKey findings on trust in institutions\\n3 More detailed results of analysis are presented in a technical report that accompanies this report and is available in the form of a working paper at\\neurofound.link/ef18036.\\n4 EU citizens also tend to have more trust in the European Court of Justice than other EU institutions.Figure 8: Trust in EU institutions, EU28, 2004–2017 (%)  \\n05101520253035404550556065\\nEU European Parliament European Commission European Central Bank\\nNote: Percentages are of the population aged 15 and over.

Some sources argue that\\nthe deterioration in the economy, the crisis and theproblems in the banking sector resulted not only in alessening of confidence in the ECB, but also in a generalfall in trust in EU institutions (Ehrmann et al, 2013).\\nThe sharpest reductions in trust in the EU between 2004\\nand 2016 occurred in countries most severely affectedby the economic downturn: Greece (-43 percentagepoints), Cyprus (-31 percentage points) and Spain(-26.5 percentage points) (Figure 9). In Ireland, trust inthe EU declined dramatically when the country was hitby the crisis (-34 percentage points between 2004 and2011; with just one person in four having confidence inthe EU in 2011), but confidence was restored as thecountry recovered, with almost half (49%) of thepopulation expressing trust in the EU in 2016. \\nIn these countries, trust in the EU declined in parallel to\\nthe decline in trust in national institutions. In Spain forinstance, trust in political parties dropped abruptlyfollowing corruption scandals and poor management ofthe crisis: in 2017, only 7% of people reported havingconfidence in political parties compared with 40% in2008. In Greece, the figure was only 4% in 2017compared to 17% in 2008. Moreover, the governmentcrises in France and Italy might have resulted in a loss ofconfidence in national government policy and in thecapacity of governments to cope with the economiccrisis and to support the European project (trust in theEU dropped by 24 percentage points in France and 26percentage points in Italy between 2004 and 2016).\\nIn contrast, in two countries (Finland and Sweden) trust\\nin the EU increased over the period despite GDP in realterms being 3% lower in 2016 than in 2008 when thecrisis hit, but in these countries it seems that theeconomic decline was perceived as being more a resultof domestic factors than of external ones. In Lithuaniaand Romania, the level of trust remained high despite aslight decrease. Both of these countries have alwayshad a higher level of trust in the EU than other countriesin the region, which suggests that their populations aremore optimistic about the EU in general or value thepositive changes that occurred after EU accession more.On the other hand, in the case of Romania, it may bethat perceived issues in the national government bysome part of the population put the EU in a favourablelight. Societal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 9 Change in trust in EU institutions, EU28, 2004–2016 (percentage point change)\\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Eurobarometer.  =<30\\n(-30, -20](-20, -10](-10, 0]0<23Despite the increase in trust in the EU in some countries\\nafter 2011, by 2016 it had not returned to the levelsreported for 2004 and 2007 in the majority of MemberStates (see Figures 9 and 10). There were just fiveMember States where over half of the population hadconfidence in the EU (Lithuania, Malta, Luxembourg andFinland) compared with six Member States where lessthan a third had confidence in the EU (Greece, France,Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Italy and the UK) in 2016.Relationship between trust in national\\ninstitutions and trust in the EU\\nThis section aims to provide a better understanding of\\nthe nature of the relationship between trust in nationalinstitutions and trust in the EU. This has importantpolicy implications because it gives an insight intowhether trust in the EU can be achieved independentlyof changes in trust in national institutions.Key findings on trust in institutions\\nFigure 10: Trust in EU institutions, 2004–2016 (%)\\n0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0GreeceFranceCyprusCzech RepublicItalyUKSpainAustriaGermanySloveniaHungarySlovakiaNetherlandsSwedenCroatiaEstoniaLatviaPolandDenmarkBelgiumPortugalBulgariaIrelandFinlandLuxembourgMaltaRomaniaLithuaniaEU28\\n2016 2011 2007 2004\\nNote: Countries are sorted according to data in 2016.\\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Eurobarometer.  24Changes in trust in EU institutions tend to be closely\\nrelated to changes in trust in national institutions.According to the literature, trust at national andEU levels might move in parallel (‘congruence’),because people might extrapolate their experience ofnational institutions to the supranational level (seeMuñoz et al, 2011). An alternative hypothesis is thattrust in national institutions and the EU might beinversely related (a ‘compensation’ or ‘substitution’effect). People living in countries with well-performinginstitutions might be less willing to support transferringsovereignty to a supranational institution, while thoseliving in countries with low-performing institutions mayhave reason to place greater trust in EU institutions.\\nTable 1 shows the correlation (that is, the linear\\nrelationship) at EU level between the proportion ofpeople who trust in national institutions and theproportion of those who trust in EU institutions over theperiod 2004–2017. Trust in the EU has a strong andsignificant positive correlation with trust in nationalgovernments and national parliaments. When the shareof people with confidence in national governments orparliaments increases, the share of those who trust inthe EU also increases, and conversely, when trust innational governments or parliaments decreases, trust inthe EU also decreases. In addition, there is a strongpositive relationship between trust in nationalparliaments and trust in the European Parliament, theEuropean Commission, the ECB and the European Courtof Justice.\\n5Accordingly, a decline in trust in national\\nparliaments will tend to be associated with a parallelreduction in respect of EU institutions. Attitudestowards national political institutions seem to play animportant role in shaping attitudes towards EUinstitutions, as underlined in the literature (Muñoz et al,2011; Radu, 2016; Obydenkova and Arpino, 2017).Analysis at country level for the period 2004–2017 (seetechnical report) confirms the results presented above.When statistically significant,\\n6the relationship between\\nthe proportion of people trusting national institutionsand the proportion of people trusting EU institutions ispositive in the majority of cases. This implies that anincrease in the proportion of people who trust innational institutions is linked to an increase in the shareof people with confidence in EU institutions, andconversely, a decrease in trust in national institutions islinked to a decrease in trust in EU institutions. \\nIt is then important to determine whether the changes\\nconcerned are similar in scale or not. For the EU as awhole, while the proportion of those who hadconfidence in national government declined by2.5 percentage points between 2004 and 2016, theproportion that had confidence in the EU fell by15.5 percentage points, which may point to ablame-shifting effect to a certain extent. This effect isalso evident in many countries where the correlation issignificant, for instance, France and Italy, where trust inthe national government declined by around13 percentage points in both cases and trust in the EUfell by around 25 percentage points. In Greece, on theother hand, the reduction over the same period in theproportion of people with confidence in the nationalgovernment and the proportion with confidence in theEU was much the same, at just over  40 percentagepoints each.\\nAlthough trust in national institutions and trust in\\nEU institutions tend to be positively correlated, in somecountries, for instance, the Czech Republic, FinlandHungary, or Estonia, the correlation tends to be low andstatistically insignificant. In a small number ofcountries, a negative correlation between trust innational institutions and EU institutions has beenfound. One example is Poland, where a significantSocietal change and trust in institutions\\nTable 1: Relationship between trust in EU institutions and trust in national institutions, 2004–2017\\nTrust in the EUTrust in\\nEuropean\\nParliamentTrust in\\nEuropean\\nCommissionTrust in\\nEuropean\\nCentral BankTrust in\\nCouncil of the\\nMinisters of\\nthe EUTrust in Court\\nof Justice of\\nthe EU\\nTrust in national government 0.805*** 0.659*** 0.675*** 0.632*** 0.828*** 0.620\\nTrust in national parliament 0.891*** 0.798*** 0.800*** 0.778*** 0.854*** 0.706*\\nTrust in political parties 0.577** 0.501* 0.518** 0.582** 0.537* 0.216\\nNote: *** signifies that the correlation coefficient is significant at the 0.1% level, ** significant at the 1% level and * significant at the 5% level.\\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Eurobarometer.\\n5 However, the findings for the correlation coefficients between the proportion of people trusting the Court of Justice of the EU and the proportion of\\npeople trusting the selected national institutions have limited reliability because of the relatively small number of observations (i.e. Eurobarometerwaves) available for the analysis.\\n6 The relationship is statistically significant for all Member States, with the exception of Germany, Hungary and Finland.25negative correlation exists between trust in political\\nparties and trust in the EU.7In addition, over the\\n2004–2017 period, when the proportion of peopletrusting national institutions declined, the proportiontrusting the ECB increased in Germany, which mightalso be interpreted as a substitution effect.\\nOne possible mechanism through which an inverse\\ncorrelation between trust in national institutions andtrust in the EU could arise is when people perceiveincreasing corruption in national institutions and thisleads them to trust the EU more. The data shows,however, that there is no simple relationship betweenthe proportion of people trusting the EU and theperception of corruption at national level. The change inthe proportion of people having confidence in the EUover the 2007–2016 period does not seem to be relatedto changes in the perception of corruption at nationallevel (see the analysis in the technical report). Key findings on trust in institutions\\n7 This means that over the period 2004–2017, while the share of people with confidence in political parties diminished, the share of those with confidence\\nin the EU increased.

In some countries, such asFrance and Italy, trust in the EU declined much morethan trust in national institutions, suggesting ablame-shifting effect. A negative relationship betweentrust only seems to apply in a few countries(for instance, Poland) or in the case of some institutions(for instance, trust in Germany in the ECB). \\nInequalities in trust levels\\nDistribution of trust in institutions accross\\nthe EU\\nBehind the averages of trust in institutions, there is of\\ncourse a more complex distribution of trust in thesocieties studied. One possibility to establish thedispersion of trust is to describe how the proportion ofthose with low trust evolved during the period. In thefollowing analysis, those with low trust have beendefined as people who have a trust level lower than 60%of the median trust level in the country in a given year.Using this relative definition of low trust is useful infocusing on the dispersion of trust responses ratherthan changes in average levels of trust. Figure 11 showsthe changes in the proportion of those with low trust inMember States.\\nIn 2007, the proportion of those with low trust was\\nlowest in the northern European countries, where fewerthan 9% of the respondents had low levels of trustrelative to the median trust level. The highest levels oflow trust were found in Bulgaria and Croatia, wheremore than 25% of the respondents had low levels oftrust. In many countries the proportion of those withlow trust increased by 2011 (some 14 countries), whilethose experiencing a decline were less numerous(five countries). Between 2011 and 2016, 10 countriesrecorded a declining percentage of those with low trust,while in other countries such as Slovenia, Slovakia,France, Croatia, Denmark, Germany and Estonia theproportion of those with low trust was higher in 2016than in 2011. Overall, during the entire period,12 countries recorded an increasing occurrence of lowtrust, while this percentage declined in 6 countries.Even if the percentage with low trust increased over theperiod in the northern European countries, theseremain the countries with the lowest occurrence of lowtrust. In 2016, Slovakia had the highest percentage ofrespondents with low trust.\\nThe dispersion of trust can also be described by using\\naggregate dispersion or inequality indices such as thestandard deviation or the Gini index. Although theoriginal trust variables are measured on an ordinalscale, the composite variables of trust in this analysisare not ordinal as they were calculated by averagingseveral items related to trust in institutions. Thesevariables are based on the assumption that thenumbers used for coding trust levels are cardinalnumbers. On the other hand, they are still bounded,with 1 being the lowest possible value and 10 being thehighest possible value. The literature indicates that thisposes a problem for inequality measurement: thus, anormalised version of the Gini index based onWagstaff’s approach (as per O’Donnell et al, 2016), wasemployed for this report. This index is suitable for usewith bounded variables. These normalised Gini indicescan take values of between 0 and 1, with higher valuesindicating a greater inequality of trust (where 0 meansan equal distribution of trust and 1 corresponds to asituation of maximal inequality). \\nAs Figure 12 (and Table A1 of the Annex) shows,\\nbetween 2007 and 2011 the inequality of overall trust ininstitutions increased the most in Spain and Cyprus(+7 points, referring to a range of Gini coefficientexpressed as 0–100). In Poland, Romania and theCzech Republic inequality was also greater in 2011 thanin 2007 by close to 5 points. Overall, 14 countriesrecorded increasing inequality between 2007 and 2016.In the same period,  a few countries recorded fallinginequality in trust in institutions. Inequality declined themost in Malta,  Luxembourg and Ireland (-4 points), butalso in Bulgaria and Lithuania. Between 2011 and 2016,when average trust in institutions increased in mostcountries, inequality declined in 13 countries. In theCzech Republic inequality declined by 11 points, and inCroatia and Greece by 6 points. During this period, theinequality of trust in institutions increased in sixcountries, most significantly in Slovakia (+7 points) andFrance (+4 points).\\nPolarisation of trust across social groups\\nThis section describes the differences in dynamics oftrust in national institutions between different societalgroups. Previous research suggests that differences intrust levels might be larger between groups thanbetween countries (Zmerli and Hooghe, 2011). However,the question investigated here is not which groups havehigher or lower levels of trust in institutions, but whichgroups exhibited the largest change in trust ininstitutions in the period of the economic crisis and theyears that followed the recession. First, changes in trustin institutions will be analysed according to basicsocioeconomic variables, such as gender, age,education, employment status and income. In addition,it is also assumed that people with declining trust arenot necessarily those whose trust level (and socialstatus) is generally low, but those who perceive threatsto their social status. The analysis will also give specificattention to the situation of the middle class, assumingthat some economic and political problems havecreated growing anxieties among middle-class people,while, on the other hand, it is generally assumed that astrong middle class is a condition of stable democracy.Societal change and trust in institutions27As perceptions about the quality of public services have\\nbeen demonstrated to affect trust in institutions, theanalysis also investigates whether changes in trust ininstitutions are similarly correlated with this factor.Making use of the concept of social cohesion (Acket etal, 2011) it is also assessed if people who perceivegrowing social tensions and feel isolated experience agreater loss of confidence in institutions.\\n8The followingsection discusses the most important results of thisanalysis, while additional figures can be found in thetechnical report.\\nThe two periods, 2007–2011 and 2011–2016, are\\nreviewed separately, as drivers of change in trust ininstitutions might be different during the crisis periodand during the period of economic recovery thatfollowed. Key findings on trust in institutions\\n8 For every individual-level variable of interest, tests were carried out to explore whether the change in trust in institutions in a given country was\\nstatistically different for the two extreme categories of that variable. For example, in the case of education, tests were conducted to see if the change intrust in institutions between 2007 and 2011 was different between those with a low level of education and those with a high level of education. To testwhether the difference between subgroups is statistically significant, separate linear regression models were run, with the grouping variable interactedwith the time dummy. The coefficient of the interaction term shows the difference between the changes of trust in institutions in the categories of thegrouping variable.

Differences between genders in terms ofchange in level of trust were only statistically significantin three countries: in Poland and Slovenia, trust ininstitutions declined more among men and less amongwomen, while in Austria trust declined more stronglyamong women. Statistically significant differencesbetween age groups were found in six countries.Although the economic crisis hit the young hard whilethe elderly were less affected, there were only threecountries (Italy, Finland and Sweden) where trust ininstitutions declined more among the young(aged 18–34) and declined less for the oldest age group(65+), while in other countries (Estonia, France, Cyprus)the pattern was reversed.\\nWith regard to labour market status and position in\\nsocial stratification, trust generally declined mostamong those in low-status positions (for instance,low education or low income). In a number of countries(France, Denmark, Estonia and the Czech Republic)statistically significant differences in terms of trustbetween the less well educated (those with lowersecondary education or below) and those with tertiaryeducation were found; in most cases, there was agreater decline in trust in institutions among the lesswell educated. The only exception was Austria, wheretrust in institutions declined more for those with tertiaryeducation. \\nIn the case of income, respondents were grouped in four\\nequal sized groups: those with low incomes (defined asbeing in the lowest quartile of the income distribution),the lower-middle quartile, the upper-middle and theupper quartile of the distribution. Here, the focus is ondifferences between the low income and the highincome quartile, while differences between themiddle-income groups will be analysed in a separatesection. Results show a more significant drop in trust ininstitutions among those with low incomes in fivecountries (Estonia, Spain, Slovakia, Latvia, Cyprus),while only one country (Austria) shows an invertedpattern where trust declined more among those with ahigh income. In other countries such as Portugal andRomania, the largest decline in trust in institutions isobserved among the middle class. In Greece, Cyprus,Slovenia and Slovakia the middle class show similarresults to those with low income, with a moresignificant decline of trust in the middle class than inthose with high income. Likewise, in Austria, the middleclass is more similar to those with low income, althoughin this case both show a more moderate decline in trustcompared to those with high income.To sum up the results for the overall trust variable, inthe first sub-period (2007–2011) the most importantgrouping variables proved to be education and incomestatus. The picture is similar when the trust in eachdifferent type of institution is analysed separately.In the case of trust in political institutions, educationappears to be the variable where the highest number ofcountries with statistically significant differences arefound. In the case of trust in non-political stateinstitutions and in the media, the most importantgrouping variables are education and income. \\n2011–2016: Perceived social exclusion and\\ndifferences in quality of public services \\nDuring the second, post-crisis sub-period (2011–2016),\\nthe most important grouping variable is perceivedquality of public services and perceived social exclusion.Although significant differences can be found betweeneducational and income groups, as well as betweengroups based on social tensions in 5–6 countries,perception of service quality and social exclusion isimportant in twice as many cases (in 11 countries).\\nPerception of quality of public services was earlier\\nidentified as an important predictor of trust ininstitutions as it represents a measure of the outcomeof the functioning of institutions. To investigate theimpact of this factor, three categories of respondentswere created, based on the EQLS items related toperceptions of service quality. The EQLS asksrespondents about their evaluation of the quality ofhealthcare, education, public transport, childcare andstate pension services in the EQLS 2007, EQLS 2011 andthe EQLS 2016, with responses coded on a 10-itemscale. Respondents were categorised based on theiraverage perception of service quality regarding theseitems: those perceiving low service quality are definedas people who scored lower than the 33rd percentile inEQLS 2007, while those perceiving high service qualityare those who had a higher score than the 66thpercentile in the EQLS 2007. Between 2011 and 2016,differences in the dynamics of trust in institutionsbetween groups based on perceptions of quality ofpublic services were found in almost half of all countries(see Figure 13). Countries with a significant differencewere Sweden, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Finland, Poland,Estonia, Austria, Latvia, Slovakia, Malta, Hungary andItaly. In every country where a significant difference wasfound, the increase in trust was significantly greateramong those who perceived high public service qualitythan among those who perceived low service quality.Societal change and trust in institutions29Feeling oneself to be socially excluded is likely to be\\nassociated with diminished trust in institutions. Theperceived social exclusion index refers to the overallaverage score from responses to four statements. Theseare: ‘I feel left out of society’, ‘Life has become socomplicated today that I almost can’t find my way’,‘I don’t feel that the value of what I do is recognised byothers’ and ‘Some people look down on me because ofmy job situation or income’. These are coded on a5-item scale (where 1 means ‘strongly disagree’ and5 means ‘strongly agree’). Between 2011 and 2016, thechange in trust in institutions differed by perceptions ofsocial exclusion in 11 countries. In nine of thesecountries, trust increased less among those who feltsocially isolated compared to those who perceived lesssocial exclusion. \\nPerceiving tensions between different groups in society\\nis also associated with diminished trust in institutions.The grouping based on the perception of social tensionsis based on a set of items which asks respondentswhether they perceive tensions (‘no tension’, ‘sometension’ or ‘a lot of tension’) in society between the poorand the rich, workers and employers, men and women,old and young, different racial and ethnic groups, anddifferent religious groups. Respondents werecategorised based on the average perceived tensionKey findings on trust in institutions\\nFigure 13: Change in trust in institutions by perception of public service quality, 2011–2016\\n-0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0Czech RepublicPortugalSpainRomaniaGreeceDenmarkIrelandLithuaniaBelgiumGermanyNetherlandsUKCroatiaCyprusFranceSwedenLuxembourgSloveniaFinlandBulgariaPolandEstoniaAustriaLatviaSlovakiaMaltaHungaryItaly\\nChange (high service quality) Change (low service quality) Change (total sample)\\nNotes: Countries are sorted according to the difference in trust between groups perceiving service quality as high and those perceiving it as low.\\nTrust measured on 10-point scale where 1 = ‘do not trust at all’ and 10 = ‘trust completely’.Source: Authors’ calculations based on EQLS  30according to the items.

A statisticallysignificant difference between those perceiving low andhigh social tensions can be found in six countries:France, Cyprus, Slovakia, Germany, Italy and Denmark(in Malta and Estonia the difference is not statisticallysignificant). In all of these cases, the increase in trust ininstitutions is greater among those who perceive a lowlevel of social tension.\\nThe divergences between the categories of the grouping\\nvariables were also studied separately for differenttypes of institutions. In the case of trust in politicalinstitutions and trust in non-political state institutions,perception of social tensions and of public servicequality were the most important grouping variables.These are the variables according to which changes ininstitutional trust differ significantly in the largestSocietal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 14: Change in trust in institutions by perception of social tensions, 2011–2016\\n-0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0FranceCyprusSlovakiaGermanyMaltaItalyEstoniaDenmarkUKLuxembourgPolandIrelandLithuaniaSloveniaAustriaRomaniaFinlandHungaryLatviaSpainNetherlandsBelgiumGreecePortugalSwedenBulgariaCroatiaCzech Republic\\nChange (high social tensions) Change (low social tensions) Change (total sample)\\nNotes: Countries are sorted according to the difference in trust between groups perceiving tensions as high and perceiving low tensions.

In particular, the resultsconcentrate on the differences in overall trust betweentwo middle income quartiles with a view to determiningwhether or not there is any polarisation between themin this respect. This focus is driven by a growing interestin social inequalities and, in particular, the situation ofthe middle class in Europe, including their perceptionsand views on society as well as on institutions.\\nAs Figure 15 illustrates, trust dynamics for all income\\nquartiles in most countries followed the general patterndiscussed previously: a decrease of trust in institutionsduring the years of economic crisis (2007–2011), and acertain recovery afterwards in 2016. There are notableexceptions, such as an overall trend of declining trust inSpain, with differences between income groupsremaining relatively small. The opposite trend has beencaptured in the UK, with overall trust going up over theperiod discussed. Similarly, there has been a rise in trustin institutions for all income groups in Germany, but inparticular for the third income quartile.\\nIn an earlier section, differences between those with low\\nincomes and high incomes have already beendiscussed, but there is increasing concern also aboutthe polarisation of the middle groups, which meansincreasing distance between upper- and low-middleclasses. Here the focus is whether polarisation of themiddle groups has taken place in terms of overallinstitutional trust. Between 2007 and 2011, astatistically significant difference in the change in trustbetween the middle income quartiles can be seen inseven countries. In Belgium, Sweden, Estonia, Greece,Ireland and Slovenia, polarisation of trust wasidentified, since trust declined more among those in thelower-middle income quartile and the decline was lesspronounced in the upper-middle quartile. The reversepattern was only found in the case of Italy. Between2011 and 2016, four countries – Bulgaria, Austria,Portugal and Italy – had the most important tendenciestowards polarisation. In these countries, institutionaltrust increased more among the upper middle classcompared to the lower middle. France and to someextent Greece and Slovenia are counter-examples, sinceinstitutional trust increased more among the lower-middle groups.As a result of these polarisation tendencies, in 2016 formore countries than previously the differences inoverall trust between the two middle income groups(higher middle or third income quartile, and lowermiddle or second income quartile) are statisticallysignificant, and the differences between third quartileand the second quartile have grown larger – see Table 2.Even though there are nominal differences between themiddle income groups at any point in time, there wereonly five countries in 2007 and four countries in 2011where these differences in overall trust were statisticallysignificant, and in some of those cases it was the lowermiddle income group that had a higher trust than thehigher middle one. By 2016, there were eight countriesin which the trust in institutions by Q3 was higher thantrust by Q2 in a statistically significant way. \\nIt may appear as a paradox that in some countries\\nwhere the overall income inequality, as measured bythe Gini coefficient, is relatively low, the gap betweenthe middle income groups in terms of their trust ininstitutions in 2016 was among the largest, such as inthe Netherlands, Czech Republic, Austria and Germany.On the other hand, some of the literature argues (seeWilkinson and Pickett, 2009) that being at the lowerlevel of the ranking creates feelings of inferiority, whichhas a negative social effect even if the distance betweenthe ranks is not particularly large. In certain countries,this gap in trust levels between the middle incomegroups has persisted over time: at all three points intime in the case of the Netherlands; in 2011 and 2016 inthe case of Ireland. \\nAn exception to the above pattern is the situation\\ncaptured in 2016 in France and Greece, where trust ininstitutions by the higher middle income group (Q3) waslower than that by the lower middle income group (Q2).In France, trust by the higher middle income group (Q3)declined most during 2007–2016 compared to changefor other income quartiles, and was lower than that ofany other income group. \\nThe future exploration of differences in trust levels\\nbetween the middle income groups would benefit fromobservation over a longer time period, and from a moresystematic assessment of how far the higher middleincome groups approximate with the top incomegroups and whether the lower income groups drifttowards the bottom income group – in this case, in theirtrust levels. However, the current results seem to pointto the emergence of a potential trend of polarisationwithin the middle. While this may be country specific,it would seem to call for the general need to monitormore closely not only the inequalities between theextreme ends of the distribution (rich and poor, such asthe S80/S20 measure\\n9) but also those that play out in\\nthe middle.  Key findings on trust in institutions\\n9 The S80/S20 ratio measures the relative disparity in the distribution of a given order of magnitude (wage, income, standard of living, etc.). For an income\\ndistribution, S80/S20 compares the mass of income held by 20% of the richest persons to that held by 20% of the poorest persons.  32Societal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 15: Overall trust in institutions, by income quartile, 2007, 2011 and 2016\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016Austria\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016Denmark\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016FinlandCountries with high levels of institutional trust\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016Luxembourg\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016Netherlands\\n4.55.05.56.06.57.07.5\\n2007 2011 2016Sweden\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Belgium\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Germany\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016EstoniaCountries with medium levels of institutional trust\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Spain\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016France\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Hungary\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Ireland\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Italy\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Malta\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016Portugal\\n3.54.04.55.05.56.06.5\\n2007 2011 2016United Kingdom\\n1 (lowest income quar/g415le)  2  3  4 (highest income quar/g415le)33Key findings on trust in institutions\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Bulgaria\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Cyprus\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Czech RepublicCountries with low levels of institutional trust\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Greece\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Croatia\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Lithuania\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Latvia\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Poland\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Romania\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Slovenia\\n2.53.03.54.04.55.05.5\\n2007 2011 2016Slovakia\\n1 (lowest income quar/g415le)  2  3  4 (highest income quar/g415le)\\nNotes: Trust measured on 10-point scale where 1 = ‘do not trust at all’ and 10 = ‘trust completely’.

The analysis isbased on EQLS 2007, 2011 and 2016. The independent variables used in the regressionmodels are presented in Tables 3 and 4. The dependentvariable is one of the trust variables defined previously:overall trust in institutions and the variables regardingtrust in different types of institution (trust in politicalinstitutions, trust in non-political state institutions andtrust in the media). As the purpose of the analysis is tostudy determinants of changes in trust in institutions,all relevant individual-level and macro-levelexplanatory variables are included in the model thatwere measured by the survey on more than oneoccasion.

Colour coding indicates the magnitude of difference between Q3\\nand Q2 in a given point of time: red means that Q3 exhibits (much) higher trust than Q2, green means that Q3 has lower trust than Q2. The statisticalsignificance of difference between Q3 and Q2 in a given year is assessed by comparison of means, with two-sided tests assuming equal variances. Forassessing whether a change in trust over time for Q3 and Q2 was different in a statistically significant way, a linear regression model was used, byapplying an interaction of income quartiles with the time dummy. The statistical significance of the coefficient of the interaction is reported.Source: Authors’ calculations based on EQLSCountry Difference in overall trust between Q3 and Q2Difference between change in trust of Q3 and change in\\ntrust of Q2 over respective time periods\\n2007 2011 2016 2011–2007 2016–2011 2016–2007\\nNetherlands 0.6** 0.4** 0.6** -0.2 0.2 0\\nCzech Republic 0.2 0.2 0.5** 0.0 0.3 0.4\\nBulgaria 0.2 -0.2 0.5** -0.4 0.8** 0.3\\nAustria -0.3 -0.1 0.5** 0.2 0.6** 0.7**\\nIreland -0.4 0.5** 0.5** 0.9** 0.0 0.9**\\nGermany 0.1 0.1 0.4** 0.0 0.3* 0.3\\nBelgium -0.2 0.3* 0.3** 0.5** 0.0 0.6**\\nPortugal -0.5** 0.0 0.3* 0.4 0.4 0.8**\\nMalta 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.0 0.3\\nItaly 0.4* 0.0 0.3** -0.5* 0.3** -0.1\\nUnited Kingdom 0.2 0.0 0.3 -0.2 0.3 0.1\\nLuxembourg -0.2 -0.2 0.3 0.0 0.5** 0.5\\nFinland 0.4** 0.3* 0.3* -0.1 0.0 -0.1\\nCyprus -0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.3\\nDenmark 0.3* 0.5** 0.2 0.2 -0.2 -0.1\\nSlovenia -0.3 0.6** 0.2 0.9** -0.4* 0.5*\\nPoland -0.1 -0.1 0.2 0.0 0.3 0.3\\nSlovakia -0.2 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.0 0.4\\nEU28 0.1* 0.1* 0.1** 0.0 0.1* 0.0\\nEstonia -0.2 0.3* 0.1 0.5* -0.2 0.3\\nCroatia 0.4** 0.3 0.1 -0.1 -0.2 -0.3\\nSweden -0.2 0.3* 0.1 0.5** -0.2 0.3\\nRomania 0.4* 0.1 0.1 -0.3 0.0 -0.3\\nSpain 0.0 -0.3* 0.0 -0.3 0.3 0.0\\nLithuania 0.1 0.1 -0.2 0.0 -0.3 -0.3\\nLatvia 0.4* 0.1 -0.3 -0.3 -0.4 -0.7**\\nHungary -0.1 0.3 -0.3 0.3 -0.5* -0.2\\nGreece -0.6** 0.1 -0.4** 0.7** -0.5** 0.2\\nFrance 0.2 0.1 -0.5** -0.1 -0.6** -0.7**35In the following analysis, multilevel random intercept\\nregression models are used to study the effect ofindependent variables. Multilevel models are suitablefor analysis of the data at hand because they take intoaccount the correlation between individuals from thesame country. These models allow for the introductionof group-level explanatory variables. They also allow forthe estimation of correct standard errors for thesevariables (Snijders and Bosker, 2012). As the data usedfor the purpose of this report include individualrespondents from different countries and there aresurveys from multiple years for each country,three-level multilevel models are used.\\n10In the following model, all variables (dependent andindependent) are centred to the grand mean (in otherwords, the EU average of the given variable).  \\nFigure 16 shows what effect various factors have on\\noverall trust in institutions. The effect size shown isbased on standardised coefficients of explanatoryvariables; standardisation is important since variableswith different measurement scales are being compared,and in this way of presenting, the effect sizes arecomparable to each other.\\n11Key findings on trust in institutions\\nTable 3:  Individual-level independent variables\\nVariables Details\\nDemographic Gender, age, urbanisation (countryside; village; medium town; city or suburb), health\\nproblems (self-rated health: bad or very bad), living alone in the household\\nSocioeconomic Education (lower secondary or below, upper secondary, tertiary), labour market status(employed, retired, unemployed/inactive), income (quartiles of equivalised householdincome)\\nPerception of the quality of public services Average of five EQLS items (see p. 28)\\nPerception of social exclusion Average of four EQLS items (see p. 29)\\nPerception of social tension Average of six EQLS items (see p. 29)\\nThree additional variables for the second sub-period (2011–2016)\\nPerception of change in own financialsituation Those reporting that their financial situation had become worse in response to the followingquestion: ‘When you compare the financial situation of your household 12 months ago andnow, would you say it has become better, worse or remained the same?’ (Q98)\\nSatisfaction with economic situation of thecountrySimilar questions were asked in the EQLS in 2011 and 2016, albeit with slightly differentwording (Q32 in 2016: satisfaction with the present state of the economy in country; Q40h in2011: satisfaction with the economic situation in country) and as part of a series of differentsatisfaction items.

Standard deviation measures the average distance ofindividual values of a given variable from the mean of its distribution.    36Results show that individual characteristics such as\\ngender, age, education, income, health andurbanisation level affect trust. More specifically, womenhave more trust in institutions in general than men.Age has a non-linear effect on overall trust ininstitutions: the middle-aged have less confidence thanthe youngest age group (16–24 years old), while amongthe elderly trust in institutions is greater than amongthe young and the middle-aged. Health problems andliving in large cities or towns have a negative effect ontrust in institutions. Trust in institutions is also relatedto social status: those with a lower education level orlow income have significantly less confidence ininstitutions than those with high education or incomelevels. For example, all else being equal, having beenthrough tertiary education increases trust in institutionsby 0.35 points (on scale 1-10) compared to those withprimary education. \\nHowever, the other individual-level predictors that have\\nbiggest impact on overall trust in institutions are theperception of quality of public services and socialtensions perceived. Perception of quality of publicservices is strongly associated with trust in institutions:a one standard deviation increase in the perceivedquality of public services increases trust in institutionsby 0.78 points. It is also clear from the regression resultsthat lack of social cohesion is associated with low trustin institutions. When there is one standard deviationincrease in perceived social tensions in society, overalltrust in institutions declines by 0.27 points.\\nAmong the macro-level variables, government integrity,\\nas measured by the Corruption Perceptions Index, andGDP per capita has a significant positive effect on trustin institutions, while income inequality and austerityhas no effect. If the Corruption Perceptions Index wereto increase by one standard deviation (meaning thatcorruption is seen as getting lower), the overall trustin institutions would become higher by 0.3 points(on a scale of 1–10). \\nA further advanced analysis was carried out to examine\\nin what way the country-level factors, such ascorruption and GDP, affect trust: whether it isabsolute levels (in other words, what is the effect ofbetween-country variation) or the within-countrySocietal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 16: Effects of individual-level and macro-level variables on trust in institutions \\n4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6 4.8 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.6 5.8Perceived quality of public servicesTertiary education (ref.

For continuous variables (e.g. quality\\nof public services), the difference of the predicted value and the EU average of trust shows the change in trust in institutions when the variable isincreased by one standard deviation. For dummy or categorical variables (these have a reference category identified in parentheses), thedifference shows how trust by a given category of people differs from the reference category. Only those factors are displayed whose effect onoverall trust is statistically significant; for a full set of variables examined, see Table A2 in the Annex. Effects of independent variables wereestimated using random intercept models on pooled data from EQLS 2007, 2011 and 2016. N=87,075. Full details of the estimation can be seen inTable A2 in the Annex.  Source: Authors’ calculations based on EQLS  37progress over time that counts. The results show that in\\nthe case of perceived corruption, the effect oninstitutional trust is mostly related to the differencesbetween countries: institutional trust tends to be higherin countries with higher average levels of CPI (that is,lower perceived corruption). An increase in governmentintegrity (increase of CPI) over time also has a positivecoefficient on institutional trust, but it is not statisticallysignificant. However, with regard to drawingconclusions, one should consider that perhaps thewithin-country changes in CPI over the period examinedwere not large enough or that longer periods areneeded for CPI to change in order to have an impact ontrust levels.\\nIn contrast, in the case of GDP per capita, the changes\\nwithin countries over time have a significant effect ontrust in institutions: in years when the GDP is higherinstitutional trust also tends to be higher. On the otherhand, the advanced analysis confirms that incomeinequality and austerity do not seem to significantlyaffect trust in institutions\\n12. \\nThe importance of independent variables was alsoinvestigated separately for two sub-periods: the crisisyears (2007–2011) and the following years (2011–2016).Among the macro-level variables, the level of theCorruption Perceptions Index significantly affects trustin institutions during the crisis years, while within-country differences in corruption over time seem to beimportant in the second sub-period that followed theeconomic crisis. During the crisis years, changes in GDPper capita also have an effect on trust in institutions,but this was not the case during the 2011-2016 period. \\nResults show that individual-level variables have similar\\neffects in the two periods (see more details in technicalreport). The data available from EQLS 2011 and 2016also allowed us to include additional control variablesin the model for the second sub-period. Among these,satisfaction with the economy of the countrysignificantly increases trust in institutions. Those whosaw their financial situation worsening during the yeartend to have lower levels of trust in institutions. Theanalysis also found that religious observance isassociated with trust in institutions, with those definedas being religious tending to have greater trust ininstitutions.\\nPatterns of correlations detected in the case of trust in\\npolitical institutions and trust in non-political stateinstitutions are similar to those described above in thecase of overall institutional trust (based on analysis ofthe pooled data of EQLS 2007, 2011 and 2016; see TableA3 in Annex). An important difference is that corruptionseems to be important in the case of trust in politicalinstitutions, but in the case of trust in non-political stateinstitutions and trust in the media, corruptionperception does not appear to have any effect. \\nMultivariate analysis of trust in the EU\\nBased on Eurobarometer data, this section analyseschanges in trust in the EU by taking into accountindividual-level and macro-level factors. It alsoexamines how far the results are in line with thoseobtained for trust in national institutions from theEQLS data.\\nThe first set of analysis looks at the effect of\\nindividual-level variables for four different years: 2004,2007, 2011 and 2016. The variables described below areincluded in logistic regression models of trust in the EU.\\nThe Eurobarometer data do not include income or the\\nhighest education level attained by individuals but theydo include employment status and occupation.Accordingly, these two variables – employment statusand occupation – are used as the proxy for the level ofeducational attainment and income. It is assumed thatthe higher the level of the occupation of the person(in terms of the skills and qualifications needed), thehigher their level of education and income. Those out ofwork are assumed to have a lower level of educationand income than those in work.\\nRecent literature on trust in EU institutions includes a\\ndiscussion of other socioeconomic and political factorsthat are likely to influence a person’s level of trust inthese institutions. Some of these factors include: theperson’s assessment of the economic situation; theirperception of whether or not the EU is doing somethingfor people; whether or not they are interested in EUpolitical affairs; and their awareness and knowledge ofthe EU. Questions on each of these aspects are regularlyincluded in the Eurobarometer surveys.\\nTable A4 in the Annex shows two sets of logistic\\nregression models where the dependent variable is thebinary indicator of ‘trust in the EU’ and the independentvariables are individual characteristics, describedabove, as well as country dummies. It should be notedthat the variable ‘trust in the national government’ isincluded in the second set of models but not in the firstset. \\nThe results obtained for trust in national institutions\\nindicate that women are more inclined to trust nationalinstitutions than men. However, this does not appear toapply to trust in the EU: only for the 2016 findings dowomen have a statistically significant greater level ofKey findings on trust in institutions\\n12 The same conclusions are obtained as a result of both the regression analysis based on a random intercept multilevel model and the OLS regression\\nmodel with country-fixed effects.   38trust in the EU than men. And the relationship between\\ntrust in the EU and age differs from that observed fortrust in national institutions. Those aged 15–24 tend totrust in the EU more than both the other age groups, afinding in line with the literature. This might beexplained by the fact that people under 25 are generallymore optimistic about the future and that they benefitfrom, and appreciate, more European programmes(such as the Erasmus programme). In 2007, 64% of thisage group trusted the EU compared with 47% in 2016.By contrast, the majority of those aged 55+ tend not totrust the EU (European Commission, 2017a). It is likelythat these people do not necessarily see the advantagesof EU integration, are more sceptical about the EU or aregenerally more pessimistic about the future. Inparticular, those aged 65+ have always had the lowestlevels of trust in the EU compared to other age groups,and have shown a large decline in trust since the onsetof the crisis: just 28% had confidence in the EU at thebeginning of 2016 compared with 50% at the beginningof 2007. However, the largest decline in trust wasamong those aged 25–49 and 50–54 (-24 percentagepoints in each case). This is relevant because both agegroups had high levels of trust in the EU in 2007(59% and 54% respectively).\\nMoreover, also in line with the results published\\npreviously (European Commission, 2017a), men, thosewith higher levels of education, students and managersare more likely to trust the EU than other groups. This isalso in line with the results obtained for trust in nationalinstitutions: the lower the level of education, the lowerthe level of trust.\\nResults also show that EU citizens are less likely to trust\\nin the EU when they perceive that the economicsituation in their country might get worse or is unlikelyto improve, or when they do not understand how the EUworks. On the other hand, they are more likely to trustin the EU when they do not consider the EU to impairtheir cultural identity.\\nAs discussed previously, trust in the national\\ngovernment seems to influence the level of trust peoplehave in the EU. Those who do not have confidence intheir national government are significantly less likely totrust the EU; and this was particularly the case duringthe crisis period.\\nWhile it seems that trust in the EU has increased in the\\nUK since the Brexit referendum (Batsaikhan and Darvas,2017), after accounting for all individual variables,figures show that the UK has almost always been theMember State with the lowest level of trust in the EU.The only exceptions were in 2004, when levels of trustwere lower in Finland and Sweden, and in 2007, whenthey were lower in Austria.\\nThe second analysis also takes into account macro-level\\nvariables that might influence trust in the EU. To fullyprofit from the rich data at hand, a pseudo-paneldataset was constructed from the waves of theEurobarometer study. The study does not follow thesame individuals over time, so it is not possible toconduct an individual-level panel analysis. However, thedata do allow the creation of groups (cohorts), whichcan be followed across specific periods. The methodadopted combines pseudo-panel data with fixed effectmodels, which allows to adjust for all omitted but fixeddifferences between cohorts that affect trust in the EU.(For more details about the methodology of theanalysis, see the technical report). \\nFour models have been tested, in all of which the\\ndependent variable is the level of trust in the EU. Models1 and 1\\' do not include the micro-level variable ‘trust innational government’, whereas Models 2 and 2\\' do.In addition, Models 1\\' and 2\\' take into account the yearsfollowing the onset of the economic crisis to seewhether this has an impact on the level of trust in theEU. Table 5 presents the findings of the analysis, whichindicate that trust in the EU is positively andsignificantly influenced by people’s understanding ofhow the EU works and a belief that EU membershipdoes not impair cultural identity. The fact that peoplebelieve that the economic situation in their country willimprove is only a significant factor when trust innational government is not included in the model.Otherwise, trust in national government seems to be themain explanatory micro-level variable.\\nAmong the country level variables, the level of\\nperceived corruption, as measured by the CorruptionPerceptions Index, does not seem to affect the level oftrust in the EU. This is confirmed for the Member Statesthat joined after 2004, when ‘number of years spent inEU membership’ is included in the two models (seetechnical report for details). In this case, however, therelationship between the number of years of EUmembership and the proportion of people trusting theEU is negative (but it is difficult to make a distinctionbetween the impact of EU accession and that of theeconomic crisis as they overlap in time).\\nIn addition, the proportion of non-nationals in the\\ncountry seems to play a significant role, particularly inModels 2 and 2\\' where trust in the national governmentis taken into account. This suggests that the relativenumber of non-nationals in a country does notnecessarily affect the level of trust in the EU. \\nFigures also confirm that the level of trust in the EU\\ndeclined significantly in the years following the onset ofthe crisis (as indicated in the sections above). However,economic growth does not seem to have a significantinfluence on the level of trust in the EU, which might beexplained by growth after the crisis not being highenough or sustained enough to restore such trust or byother factors that come into play. On the other hand,high unemployment in a country is associated withfewer people having confidence in the EU. \\nSocietal change and trust in institutions39Consequences of changes in\\ntrust levels\\nThis section examines some possible consequences of\\ntrust. As the literature review mentions, previousstudies suggest that trust in institutions may: providethe necessary political support for policy reforms; makepolicy implementation, including tax enforcement,more effective; and spur political engagement. Thissection provides some preliminary empirical analysisconcerning these claims.Trust and EU policy reforms\\nThe relationship between the level of support forEU reforms and the degree of trust in EU institutions isexamined based on Eurobarometer data analysis inTable 6. Figures for the EU overall show a strongpositive and significant relationship over the period2004–2017 between trust in EU institutions and supportfor reforms, specifically the single currency, a commonforeign policy, a common defence policy and future EUenlargement. When trust in the EU increases, supportfor the proposed reforms increases as well, andconversely when trust declines, support for theproposed reforms decreases. This is particularly true forEU enlargement, and to a lesser extent with regard to acommon defence policy (Figure 17). The consequencesof an increase in trust in the EU therefore vary accordingto the areas of reform concerned.

For example, in 2016,someone expressing trust in the EU was 2.7 times morelikely to support the single currency than someone whodoes not have such trust and three times more likely tosupport a common foreign policy (see separatetechnical report). In all countries, those who haveconfidence in the EU are more likely to support reformsthan those with limited confidence, but the scale of thelikelihood differs markedly between countries, as wellas between the reforms in question. For example, in2016, those with confidence in the EU in Greece werealmost nine times more likely to support the singlecurrency than those with low trust, whereas in Denmarkand Sweden (countries which do not belong to the eurozone), those expressing trust in the EU were only aroundtwice as likely to support a single currency than others.In addition, in Greece, those with confidence in the EUwere only just over twice as likely to supportEU enlargement than others, considerably less than thelikelihood in respect of the single currency or commonforeign and defence policies (around eight times morelikely and ten times more likely than others,respectively). \\nBetween 2004 and 2016, however, these odds ratios\\ndeclined in the EU as a whole, meaning that thelikelihood of those having confidence in the EU alsosupporting reforms was less in 2016 than 12 yearsearlier. This was particularly for the single currency: theodds ratio declined from 3.7 to 2.7. On the other hand,although the odds ratio declined in most countries, itincreased in a significant minority of countries. Therewas, therefore, no common tendency for those withconfidence in the EU to become less supportive ofreforms than other people across the EU. In 2016, in theCzech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Italy and Lithuania, thelikelihood that those who had confidence in the EUwould also support a single currency and commonforeign and defence policies was greater than in 2004.Accordingly, in these countries, it was increasingly thecase that those supporting these three policies werepeople with confidence in the EU.

In these countries, euro-scepticism is relatively widespread, at least atgovernment level (especially in Poland and Slovakia),but an above average proportion of the population trustthe EU. Between 2004 and 2016, the likelihood thatthose trusting the EU also support the single currencyincreased significantly in three of the countries,Hungary being the exception, while the proportionsupporting a common foreign policy rose significantly inthe Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, butremained unchanged in Poland. Those with confidencein the EU were also more likely to support a commondefence policy in 2016 than in 2004 in all four countries,but less likely to support future enlargement in three ofthem, the exception in this case being Slovakia, wherethe proportion of those expressing support increasedduring the period 2004–2016. Overall, it can beconcluded that there was a widespread, though by nomeans common, tendency for the link between trust inthe EU and support for reforms to weaken over theperiod.\\nTrust and tax compliance\\nStudies of trust and tax compliance generally useattitudinal data to explore the association betweentrust and tax compliance motives. Instead, Figure 18shows the association between trust attitudesand an ‘objective’ measure of tax avoidance: thevalue-added tax (VAT) gap, defined as the differencebetween expected VAT and VAT revenues collected in agiven country. Note that factors other than fraud andtax evasion (like bankruptcies, financial insolvenciesand miscalculations) also affect the size of the VAT gap.\\nAs shown by Figure 18, there is a strong negative\\nassociation between levels of trust in institutions andKey findings on trust in institutions\\nRO\\nEL\\nSICZLTLV\\nIT\\nES PT\\nFRUKSK\\nPLHU\\nIEMT\\nBG\\nDEBEDK\\nNLEE\\nAT\\nFISELU\\n0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%\\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80%VAT gap, 2011\\nTrust in government, 2011 (%)Figure 18: Trust in institutions and the VAT gap: association between levels and changes, 2011–2015 \\nNote: VAT gap expressed as percentage of VAT total theoretical liability (see CASE and IHS, 2017).  \\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on EQLSESIT\\nSIPT FR\\nCYPL\\nHRBG\\nLVRO\\nEL\\nIECZSK\\nLT\\nHU\\nUK\\nATBE\\nEEDEDK\\nNL\\nSEMT\\nFI\\nLU\\n-5%0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%\\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%VAT gap, 2015\\nTrust in government, 2015 (%)\\nATBE\\nBGCZDE\\nDK\\nEEEL\\nESFIFR\\nHUIEIT LTLU\\nLV\\nMTNLPL\\nPTRO\\nSESISKUK\\n-20-15-10-505\\n-20 -10 0 10 20 30Percentage point change in the VAT gap\\nPercentage point change in trust in government42the size of VAT gaps in 2011. The same pattern is\\nobservable in 2015, although the strength of theassociation is weaker and the deviation from the trendline is larger. The association between changes in bothtrust in institutions and VAT gap indicators is alsonegative, although quite weak. However, a few outliersmight have a considerable effect on the weakness of theassociation. Overall, it can be said that trust ininstitutions and the VAT gap show the expectedassociation, both in terms of the cross-sectional and thelongitudinal analysis.Trust and political activity\\nPolitical science literature underlines the complexrelationship between trust in political institutions andpolitical participation (see for instance, Gabriel, 2017).According to the culturalist approach to democracy,political trust and participation are both part of the civicculture that supports democracy, while another strandof research examines political trust as the predictor ofpolitical participation. The understanding of trust as apredictor of political participation suggests that thosewho have low trust in political institutions or leadersSocietal change and trust in institutions\\nFigure 19: Proportion of those with low trust in political institutions and no political participation,\\n2011 and 2016 (%)\\n0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0FinlandNetherlandsSwedenLuxembourgDenmarkBelgiumAustriaGermanyUKMaltaIrelandEstoniaFrancePortugalHungarySlovakiaCzech RepublicItalyCyprusLithuaniaPolandSpainLatviaRomaniaSloveniaCroatiaBulgariaGreece\\n2011 2016\\nNote: Countries are sorted according to data in 2016. For more details, see Table A5 of the Annex.\\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on EQLS  43would engage less in conventional forms of political\\naction but could be more willing to participate in otherforms of participation (such as political protests).Without intending to analyse the causal connectionbetween political trust and participation, theassociation of the two will be described in this section.The motivation for this is that the decline in trust ininstitutions could be considered as less problematic if itdoes not go together with a decline of politicalparticipation. If the erosion of trust is accompanied byan increase in political engagement, this may be anindication of the rise of critical citizens who give voice totheir discontent. On the other hand, if falling trust ininstitutions is coupled with decreasing politicalparticipation, then one may assume that politicalcynicism prevails. \\nFor the purpose of this analysis, political participation is\\nbased on four items that are present in both EQLS 2011and 2016: ‘attended a meeting of a trade union, politicalparty or political action group’; ‘attended a protest ordemonstration’; ‘contacted a politician or publicofficial’; and ‘signed a petition, including onlinepetition’. If the respondent had participated in any ofthese activities they were coded as politically active,otherwise they were considered politically inactive. Figure 19 shows the percentage of those who did nottrust the political institutions and did not participate inpolitics in 2011 and 2016. There is a huge differencebetween the Member States in the percentage of peoplewho are characterised by low trust (who score 4 orlower on the 10-point trust in institutions scale) and donot participate in politics. In the Member States insouth-eastern Europe, the percentage is above 50%,while in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands andLuxembourg it is below 10%. The percentage of thosewith low levels of trust and no political participationdeclined in an overwhelming majority of the countries(22 out of 28 countries) between 2011 and 2016. Themost important exceptions are France, Spain andCroatia. The main driver of this decline has beenincreasing political trust during this period, however ina smaller number of countries increasing participationamong those with low trust also contributed (see moredetails in Table A5 in the Annex). In Austria, Belgium,Finland, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia andthe UK, political participation actually increased amongthose with low levels of political trust. In this group ofcountries, there is thus a sign of a rising critical citizenphenomenon. In another group of countries however,consisting of Greece, Cyprus, Spain, the Czech Republic,Croatia and Romania, political participation declinedamong those with low levels of political trust.\\nKey findings on trust in institutions45This report presents the findings of an analysis of the\\ndynamics of trust in institutions in EU countries duringthe past 15 years. The study uses rich repeatedcross-sectional data from the EQLS and Eurobarometersurvey to observe changes of trust in institutions duringthis period. There are, of course, limitations of thestudy, one of which is the lack of individual panel datato study the dynamics of trust in institutions.Furthermore, although the data allow to take intoaccount important determinants of trust in institutions(like perceptions of the quality of public services orsocial tensions), some other determinants identified inthe literature (for instance, Murtin et al, 2018) have notbeen measured or, at least, not at different time pointsin the data used. These include potential determinantssuch as a migrant background or political preferences.This has limited the authors’ capacity to explore issueslike the effect of migration or political polarisation onchanges of trust in institutions. \\nThe results validate the initial assumptions about the\\ncomplex, context-dependent and dynamic nature oftrust in institutions. Despite the generalisations thatoccur sometimes in the scholarly literature and, moreoften, in the media about the crisis of trust, data show amore differentiated picture. Still, the following pointspresent an overview of the most important and, inseveral respects, novel results of this research.\\nDecline in trust is temporary and variable\\nThe review of the trends in trust in institutions since thebeginning of the century does not reveal a uniformtendency of declining trust in national institutions inMember States. Looking at three waves of EQLS dataalso suggests that the decline in trust in institutionsduring the crisis years has been a temporaryphenomenon in many countries: between 2011 and2016 trust in institutions increased (although it did notoften return to pre-crisis levels). The dynamics of trustin EU countries since the beginning of the century canvary by type of institution, by sub-period and bycountry.\\nNational political institutions most affected\\nTrust in national political institutions (parliament andgovernment institutions) was most affected by thecrisis: it declined significantly during the crisis years butbounced back afterwards in many countries. Trust inthe legal system and the police is somewhat greater inEU countries compared to trust in political institutions,and changes in trust in these institutions have beenmore moderate. During the crisis years, the fall in trustin non-political state institutions was smaller than thefall in trust in political institutions, but during thesecond sub-period (2011–2016) the increase in trust wasalso more moderate.Patterns of trust differ across EUTrust dynamics and itineraries differ considerablyacross Europe. Overall, trust in institutions has beenmore volatile in southern and eastern Europeancountries as well as in Ireland, but has remained more\\nstable in western and northern European countries andthe Baltic states. Most countries experienced somedecline around the time of the economic crisis, but trustthen more or less bounced back in most cases.However, some eastern and southern Europeancountries have experienced a slow and continuousdecline in trust levels. \\nTrust in the EU declined in a majority of countries\\n(20 out of 28), and only a minority of countries saw aflat-lining or an increase of trust in the EU over the\\nperiod. Trust in the EU also followed differenttrajectories across countries. On average it declined overthe period, as the deterioration in trust was followed bya more modest recovery, although there have beensome recent improvements. This is largely due to thedynamic in eastern European countries, where generallygreater trust in the EU has moved closer to the levels ofconfidence in national institutions, although trust in theEU still remains higher than trust in national institutionsacross the eastern Member States.\\nRole of key factors\\nAnother aim of the present report is to uncover thefactors driving change in trust in institutions. Theinvestigation of differences in trust dynamics betweensocial groups shows that in the crisis sub-period (2007–2011), the most important differences were attributableto education level and income status. The decline intrust was more significant among those in low-statuspositions (for instance, low education or low income).During the post-crisis sub-period (2011–2016), the mostimportant grouping variable was perceived quality ofpublic services. In every country where significantdifferences were found, there was a noticeably greaterincrease in trust among those who perceived the qualityof public services to be high compared to those whoperceived low service quality.\\nThe multivariate analysis of drivers of trust in national\\ninstitutions confirms the effect of perceptions of public\\nservice quality on trust in institutions. The analysishighlights that trust in institutions also relates toindicators of social cohesion. The perception of tensionin society and the feeling of social exclusion decreasestrust in institutions. Among the macro-level variables,the impact of corruption on trust is the most robust\\nresult. Respondents living in countries with higher levelsof perceived corruption have less trust in institutions,and increases in perceived corruption are associatedwith a decline in trust in institutions. During the crisis\\n3Conclusions  46period, within-country changes in GDP per capita also\\nproved to have an effect on trust in institutions. Theeffect of income inequality on trust features only in\\ncross-sectional analysis of the years following the crisis,and not in later years.\\nIn the case of drivers of trust in the EU, the report\\nreveals that EU citizens are less likely to trust in the EU ifthey think that the economic situation in their country\\nmay get worse or if they think it is unlikely to improve,or if they do not understand how the EU works. On theother hand, they are more likely to have confidence inthe EU if they do not consider it to impair their culturalidentity. However, the level of perceived corruptiondoes not seem to affect the level of trust in the EU.\\nThe relationship between the proportion of people with\\nconfidence in national institutions and the proportionwith confidence in EU institutions is positive in themajority of countries for the period 2004–2017.Therefore, an increase in the proportion of people thattrust national institutions is linked with an increase inthe share of people that trust EU institutions and,conversely, a decline in trust in national institutions is\\nlinked with a decline in trust in EU institutions. In\\naddition, substitution effects are evident in a fewcountries in the case of specific EU institutions. The dataalso suggests that there may be a blame-shifting effectin some countries to a certain extent, with trust in theEU declining more considerably than trust in thenational government.\\nPolicy pointers\\nThere are a number of positive practical consequencesof public trust in institutions, some of which areexamined in this report. First, since trust essentiallyinvolves expectations concerning the future, itstabilises social interactions as it lowers transaction\\ncosts and increases predictability. Stable andtrustworthy state institutions are an importantcondition for the development of the private sector.Second, if people have confidence in institutions, theyare more likely to be amenable to policy reforms, evencostly or risky ones. This report demonstrates that theassociation between trust and support for reforms alsoholds in the case of the EU institutions. Third, trustmakes policy implementation easier as people are\\nmore willing to obey state authorities and the law, paytaxes or take part in collective action. This report findsthat in countries with more confidence in institutions,tax evasion is lower. Additionally, a decrease in trustmay lead to increased support for populist and radicalparties. \\nDespite the recent worries expressed publicly about the\\ndecline of trust in institutions and spreading discontentand cynicism, data show that the erosion of publicconfidence is not irreversible. This is an importantpolicy message. However, it is also apparent thatpatterns of trust dynamics differ considerably acrosscountries and the factors behind this vary. In otherwords, there is no ‘quick fix’ nor a ‘one-size-fits-all’solution to the problem of trust. Politicians andpolicymakers should design targeted programmes to\\ncope with the specific challenges in the given country orin a given context.\\nDespite the complex and context-bound nature of trust\\nin institutions, some general recommendations can bedrawn from this analysis. Improving macroeconomicconditions and increasing incomes are certainlyimportant ways of improving trust; however, in contrastto some widespread opinions, economic conditions arenot the only factor at play. Some Member States that\\nunderwent austerity measures during the crisismanaged to do so without much decline in trust ininstitutions. Focusing on the most vulnerable groups insociety, improving social cohesion, reducing incomeinequalities and moderating social tensions can help torecover and further build trust. Improving the quality ofpublic services is also a key factor in strengthening trust\\nin governments. Finally, public confidence requirescorruption control measures and the promotion ofpublic integrity.\\nEducation is also beneficial for trust: people that are\\nmore educated generally have more confidence inpublic institutions. This applies to the case of trust inthe EU as well. Moreover, people who are moreknowledgeable about EU institutions express moreconfidence towards the EU. Since trust in the EU hasconsiderably diminished in eastern European countrieswhere education levels are relatively lower, andknowledge about how democracy works in the EU is stilllimited, one potential policy initiative is to focus oneffective information flows and communication aboutthe EU, especially in eastern European Member States.\\nPeople are more inclined to trust the EU if they believe\\nthat the EU does not impair their cultural identity. Achallenge for European policymakers and (national)politicians is to find a way to balance a clear expressionof European values and respect for national and localcultures.\\nTo sum up, trust in institutions provides a useful policy\\ntool for measuring the legitimacy of, and support for,public institutions. Governments and internationalbodies should consider regular and high-quality datacollection about trust in institutions and related\\nvariables concerning public perceptions of theeffectiveness, integrity and normative legitimacy ofinstitutional operation. Policymakers would benefitfrom understanding and promoting trust by regularlymeasuring and examining its (often very specific andcontext dependent) roots so that appropriate measurescan be taken to nurture trust.Societal change and trust in institutions47Acemoglu, D. and Robinson, J.A.

Surveys\\nand Eurobarometer show, the sharp decline intrust in institutions was a temporary phenomenonduring the recession. In some Member States, trustin the EU declined more during this period thantrust in national governments, but trust in the EUhas generally remained higher than trust innational governments in most countries. Thereport shows that moderating social tensions andfeelings of social exclusion can help to stem thedecline in trust. However, to boost trust ininstitutions, improving the quality of publicservices is the most powerful driver. A number ofencouraging and practical consequences resultfrom trust in public institutions: for example,countries with higher trust in political institutionshave a lower level of tax evasion (VAT gap) andgreater public support for policy reforms.   \\nThe European Foundation for the Improvement of\\nLiving and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is atripartite European Union Agency whose role is toprovide knowledge in the area of social,employment and work-related policies.Eurofound was established in 1975 by CouncilRegulation (EEC) No. 1365/75 to contribute to theplanning and design of better living and workingconditions in Europe.TJ-03-18-485-EN-N\\nISBN: 978-92-897-1796-0\\ndoi:10.2806/736845\\nQuestion: Trust is important in politics?\\nHelpful Answer:'"
